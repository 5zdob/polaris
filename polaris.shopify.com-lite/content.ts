          "![Screen showing the new type styles](/images/type-updates-feature@2x.png)\n\n---\n\nThis is an Alpha release of the new type system. That means we’re making the new Text component and Figma text styles available but there could still be significant developments made. Our goal is to share the work so that you can: **understand what’s changing**, **start using the typography updates**, and **provide feedback to help us improve.**\n\n**_🚧 Please note: Since significant changes could still be made, please work with your team and the Polaris team to determine what's best for your situation._**\n\nWant more details? Let’s dive in!\n\n## Why are we making changes?\n\nAs more merchants use the Shopify admin to run their businesses, we need to evolve it to feel less like a website and more like a power tool. To do this, we need to establish a strong foundation at the center of our design system and typography plays an important role.\n\nEarlier this year, we invested a lot of time in [building up our design tokens](https://ux.shopify.com/putting-the-system-back-in-our-design-system-b2c55a392dea) as a first step in strengthening the foundation and increasing Polaris token coverage. After that release, we saw that there was still only ~8% coverage of typography in custom components in `shopify/web`. We discovered that teams were creating new components or hard coding css values for type to work around the system.\n\nHere are key reasons for this divergence:\n\n- A lack of flexibility in our 6 typography components (DisplayText, Heading, Subheading, Caption, TextStyle, and VisuallyHidden)\n- Little guidance on how to design with typography\n- A lack of range in font weights and sizes\n\nSimplifying our type components and improving our foundation will add the flexibility that will help product teams quickly make significant changes across Shopify’s admin.\n\n## What's changing\n\n### Type styles\n\nPolaris typography is getting a refresh. Currently, there are **4 Display**, **1 Heading**, **1 Subheading**, **1 Button**, **1 Body**, and **1 Caption** variants.\n\nThe updates will simplify type into two categories: **Heading** and **Body**. Each has a default set of variants along with a set of options to allow for flexibility and a wide range of applications within the UI.\n\n![Screen showing the differences between the new type styles and the old type styles](/images/type-new-to-old@2x.png)\n\n## Type scale\n\nWe’ve updated the type scale and we’re moving from two scales to one for both desktop and mobile web. Some values have been removed and others added to cover a wide range of uses in the UI.\n\nAll font sizes have a ratio of 1.2, known as the major third type scale. This means that each size is multiplied or divided by 1.2 from the previous size, starting with the base size, and rounded to a multiple of 4px. For example, if I take my base value of 14px and multiply it by 1.2, I get a value of 16px as the next increment in the scale.\n\n| New scale | Old scale |      |\n| --------- | --------- | ---- |\n| 12px      | 12px      | 13px |\n| 14px      | 14px      | 15px |\n| 16px      | 16px      | 16px |\n| 20px      | 20px      | 17px |\n| 24px      | 26px      | 21px |\n| 28px      | 28px      | 24px |\n| 32px      | 42px      | 27px |\n| 40px      | -         | -    |\n\n### Why were values changed or removed?\n\nThe smaller sizes in the scale have largely stayed the same with the majority of the changes made to the larger values.\n\n**Changing values**\nThe first change we made was updating the values of both size and line-height to be multiples of 4 with the exception of the 14px base size. This helps us be critical about the size values we use for other elements in the UI. This is important because it affects the rhythm of the page.\n\n**Adding values**\nWe added `32px` to have an extra step at the larger end of the scale. We made this decision after looking at what font sizes are being used across the different pages in the Shopify admin. Pages that are geared towards learning or celebrating key moments often use the larger sizes. We also found that additional sizes were being added or adjusted to fill in the gaps.\n\nWe considered those common values that we were noticing being added and adjusted the scale to work for those different pages.\n\n### Why one type scale?\n\nWe looked at how type changes between the different screen sizes and found that it’s often a difference of 1px. While 1px can make a visual difference, after talking to designers and developers, we came to the conclusion that the added complexity of having two distinct scales and two sets of text styles just wasn’t worth it. They often didn’t even realize a change in size happened or expected the size to actually decrease instead of increase as it does now.\n\nHowever, for the larger sizes in the scale, we believe, in most cases, it makes sense for those sizes to adjust automatically so the sizes look appropriate for the screen size they’re being displayed on. This behavior hasn’t been added yet but, in the next release, we’ll update the larger styles to respond automatically at certain breakpoints with all other sizes staying the same unless specified otherwise.\n\n![Screen showing how type styles adapt at different screen sizes](/images/type-responsive-styles@2x.png)\n\n## Typography components\n\nWe’re moving from 6 components (DisplayText, Heading, Subheading, Caption, VisuallyHidden, TextStyle) to a singular Text component.\n\n## Why one component?\n\nTo start, the team prototyped both a singular and multiple component approach. We then tested these prototypes with developers and the response was overwhelmingly in favor of the singular Text component.\n\nOverall, developers perceived the singular component as easier to use and understand. They could type in a property and see all the possible options right from their code editor. They didn’t have to import 6+ components and figure out the right one to use.\n\nOther benefits of the singular component:\n\n- One component to learn and read documentation on\n- Autocompleting props helps developers to learn the different typography options quickly\n- Less complexity in code which results in improved performance\n- Decouples layout from type\n- Easier to make sweeping changes to type\n- Provides us with a more flexible way to control type within components\n- Sets us up for future style override work to provide even more flexibility\n- Provides one way to control typography\n- There is low usage of a lot of the old typography components\n\n## Typography tokens\n\nWe have updated and streamlined token values, and updated token names to reflect a token naming convention that makes tokens easier to use and understand.\n\n### Font-size tokens\n\nWe updated the size tokens to use increments of 100 for the variants. This allows us to set `--p-font-size-100` as the base and go lower (` --p-font-size-75` ) or higher (`--p-font-size-200`) as needed numerically.\n\n| New token         | Old token        | px value | rem value |\n| ----------------- | ---------------- | -------- | --------- |\n| --p-font-size-75  | --p-font-size-1  | 12       | 0.75      |\n| -                 | --p-font-size-2  | 13       | 0.8125    |\n| --p-font-size-100 | --p-font-size-3  | 14       | 0.875     |\n| -                 | --p-font-size-4  | 15       | 0.9375    |\n| --p-font-size-200 | --p-font-size-5  | 16       | 1         |\n| -                 | --p-font-size-6  | 17       | 1.0625    |\n| --p-font-size-300 | --p-font-size-7  | 20       | 1.25      |\n| -                 | --p-font-size-8  | 21       | 1.3125    |\n| --p-font-size-400 | --p-font-size-9  | 24       | 1.50      |\n| -                 | --p-font-size-10 | 26       | 1.625     |\n| -                 | --p-font-size-11 | 27       | 1.6875    |\n| --p-font-size-600 | --p-font-size-12 | 28       | 1.75      |\n| --p-font-size-500 | -                | 32       | 2         |\n| --p-font-size-700 | -                | 40       | 2.5       |\n\n### Line-height tokens\n\n| New token         | Value | Old token              | Value |\n| ----------------- | ----- | ---------------------- | ----- |\n| --p-line-height-1 | 16    | --p-font-line-height-1 | 16    |\n| --p-line-height-2 | 20    | --p-font-line-height-2 | 20    |\n| --p-line-height-3 | 24    | --p-font-line-height-3 | 24    |\n| --p-line-height-4 | 28    | --p-font-line-height-4 | 28    |\n| --p-line-height-5 | 32    | --p-font-line-height-5 | 32    |\n| --p-line-height-6 | 40    | --p-font-line-height-6 | 36    |\n| --p-line-height-7 | 48    | --p-font-line-height-7 | 44    |\n\n## Using the typography updates\n\nThe new `Text` component and Figma text styles are available in alpha. You can start using the new component and styles now but be aware they’re still in development and there could be breaking changes. The existing type components will continue to be available for use until the new `Text` component is finalized.\n\nAs you start to use the new component, please share feedback with the Polaris team to help us continuously improve the type system.\n\n## What’s next?\n\nNext, we’ll be releasing the beta version of the component. The beta release will include:\n\n- Updating Polaris components to use the new `Text` component\n- Adding a deprecation warning to the old type components\n- Adding responsive styles\n- Updating components in the Figma UI Kit to use the new text styles\n- Updating design and API documentation\n\nDon’t worry, we’ll also provide a timeline and guidance for migration.\n\n## Resources\n\n- [Text component](http://polaris.shopify.com/components/typography/text)\n- [Figma text styles](https://www.figma.com/file/tbm3yEIZsOuHS7xJu9zy6Q/text-styles?node-id=5457%3A5710)\n- [Figma guides](https://www.figma.com/file/tbm3yEIZsOuHS7xJu9zy6Q/text-styles?node-id=5523%3A51)",

          '## Best practices\n\nButtons should:\n\n- Be clearly and accurately labeled.\n- Lead with a strong, actionable verb.\n- Use established button colors appropriately. For example, only use a red button for an action that’s difficult or impossible to undo.\n- Prioritize the most important actions. Too many calls to action can cause confusion and make merchants unsure of what to do next.\n- Be positioned in consistent locations in the interface.\n\n### Buttons versus links\n\nButtons are used primarily for actions, such as “Add”, “Close”, “Cancel”, or “Save”. Plain buttons, which look similar to links, are used for less important or less commonly used actions, such as “view shipping settings”.\n\nLinks are used primarily for navigation, and usually appear within or directly following a sentence.\n\nThe HTML that renders for the `Button` and `Link` components carries meaning. Using these components intentionally and consistently results in:\n\n- a more inclusive experience for assistive technology users\n- a more cohesive visual experience for sighted users\n- products that are easier to maintain at scale\n\n---\n\n## Content guidelines\n\nButtons should follow the content guidelines for [buttons](https://polaris.shopify.com/content/actionable-language#buttons).\n\n---\n\n## Related components\n\n- To combine or lay out multiple buttons, [use the button group component](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/actions/button-group)\n- For navigational actions that appear within or directly following a sentence, use the [link component](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/link)\n\n---\n\n## Accessibility\n\nButtons can have different states that are visually and programmatically conveyed to merchants.\n\n- Use the `ariaControls` prop to add an `aria-controls` attribute to the button. Use the attribute to point to the unique `id` of the content that the button manages.\n- If a button expands or collapses adjacent content, then use the `ariaExpanded` prop to add the `aria-expanded` attribute to the button. Set the value to convey the current expanded (`true`) or collapsed (`false`) state of the content.\n- Use the `disabled` prop to set the `disabled` state of the button. This prevents merchants from being able to interact with the button, and conveys its inactive state to assistive technologies.\n- Use the `pressed` prop to add an `aria-pressed` attribute to the button.\n\n#### Navigation\n\nMerchants generally expect buttons to submit data or take action, and for links to navigate. If navigation is required for the button component, use the `url` prop. The control will output an anchor styled as a button, instead of a button in HTML, to help convey this difference.\n\nFor more information on making accessible links, see the [link component](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/link).\n\n### Labeling\n\nThe `accessibilityLabel` prop adds an `aria-label` attribute to the button, which can be accessed by assistive technologies like screen readers. Typically, this label text replaces the visible text on the button for merchants who use assistive technology.\n\nUse `accessibilityLabel` for a button if:\n\n- The button’s visible text doesn’t adequately convey the purpose of the button to non-visual merchants\n- The button has no text and relies on an icon alone to convey its purpose\n\nTo help support merchants who use speech activation software as well as sighted screen reader users, make sure that the `aria-label` text includes any button text that’s visible. Mismatches between visible and programmatic labeling can cause confusion, and might prevent voice recognition commands from working.\n\nWhen possible, give the button visible text that clearly conveys its purpose without the use of `accessibilityLabel`. When no additional content is needed, duplicating the button text with `accessibilityLabel` isn’t necessary.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n```jsx\n<Button>Edit shipping address</Button>\n```\n\n```jsx\n<Heading>Shipping address</Heading>\n<Button accessibilityLabel="Edit shipping address">Edit</Button>\n```\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n```jsx\n<Button accessibilityLabel="Change your shipping address">Edit</Button>\n```\n\n```jsx\n<Button accessibilityLabel="Edit">Edit</Button>\n```\n\n</div></div>\n\n#### External links\n\nWhen you use the button component to create a link to an external resource:\n\n- Use the `external` prop to make the link open in a new tab (or window, depending on the merchant’s browser settings)\n- Use the `icon` prop to add the `external` icon to the button\n- Use the `accessibilityLabel` prop to include the warning about opening a new tab in the button text for non-visual screen reader users\n\nFor more information on making accessible links, see the [link component](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/link).\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n```jsx\n<Button\n  accessibilityLabel="Terms and conditions (opens a new window)"\n  icon={ExternalMinor}\n  url="http://example.com"\n  external\n>\n  Terms and conditions\n</Button>\n```\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n```jsx\n<Button url="http://example.com" external>Terms and conditions</Button>\n<Button url="http://example.com" external>\n  Terms and conditions\n</Button>\n```\n\n</div></div>\n\n### Keyboard support\n\nButtons use browser defaults for keyboard interactions.\n\n- Give buttons keyboard focus with the <kbd>tab</kbd> key (or <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>tab</kbd> when tabbing backwards)\n- Activate buttons with the <kbd>enter</kbd>/<kbd>return</kbd> key or the <kbd>space</kbd> key\n\n#### Custom key events\n\nUse the `onKeyDown`, `onKeyPress`, and `onKeyUp` props to create custom events for buttons. With these props, you can use buttons to create complex, custom interactions like drag-and-drop interfaces.\n\nSince these props introduce non-standard features to buttons, make sure to include accessible instructions so that merchants can understand how to use these features.',

Don’t use permissive language like “you can”.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\nGet performance for all your sales channels.\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\nNow you can get performance data for all your sales channels.\n\n</div></div>\n\n- Structured for merchant success: always put the most critical information first.\n- Clear: use the verb “need” to help merchants understand when they’re required to do something.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\nTo buy a shipping label, you need to enter the total weight of your shipment, including packaging.\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\nTo buy a shipping label, you must enter the total weight of your shipment, including packaging.\n\n</div></div>\n\n### Call-to-action button\n\nButtons should be:\n\n- Clear and predictable: merchants should be able to anticipate what will happen when they click a button.

This helps with readability and provides structure to screen reader users.\n\nIf you use the `subdued` prop on a card or section, make sure that the card or section `title` conveys the reason for using `subdued`.

If a heading tag is needed for display text, use the `element` prop to set the heading level.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\nUse display text to create visual interest along with a meaningful heading structure.\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\nUse display text in place of standard headings.

          '## Best practices\n\nSettings toggles should:\n\n- Include a title\n- Include body content describing the experience when the setting is turned on\n- Use a badge to clearly indicate whether the setting is turned on or off\n- Use a default button for both states. A primary button can be misinterpreted as the setting being turned on.\n\nIf more information is needed to explain setting details or functionality, include the [Info](https://polaris.shopify.com/icons?icon=InfoMinor&q=) icon and link to help content or related documentation.\n\n### Usage\n\nThe setting toggle component should only be used when:\n\n- The setting is stand alone\n- There are two binary options that are “On”/“Off”\n\nIf the setting is dependent on other settings, uses progressive disclosure, or has options that are not a simple “On”/“Off”, use a different UI element such as [Checkbox](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/selection-and-input/checkbox) or [Radio button](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/selection-and-input/radio-button).\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\nOnly include the actions Turn on/ Turn off.\n\n![Setting toggle do](/images/Do.png)\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\nDon\'t include additional settings or inputs.\n\n![Setting toggle dont](/images/Dont.png)\n\n</div></div>\n\n---\n\n## Content guidelines\n\n### Card title\n\nThe setting toggle title should:\n\n- Be the setting name, written as a noun or gerund (-ing) phrase (“Test mode” or “Automatic order archiving”)\n- Represent the experience when the setting is turned on—even if the setting restricts, limits, removes, or hides functionality\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- Test mode\n- Order archiving\n- Self-serve returns\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- Simulate test payments\n- Automatically archive the order\n- Allow customers to manage returns\n\n</div></div>\n\n### On/Off button\n\nThe button for the setting toggle should always say either “Turn on” or “Turn off” depending on whether the setting can be turned on or off.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- Turn on\n- Turn off\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- Enable\n- Disable\n- Activate\n- Deactivate\n\n</div></div>\n\n### Supporting content\n\nIn addition to the setting description, supporting content can dynamically display based on state. This should be used sparingly and included only if it adds significant clarity or value. For example, “Your customers won’t receive automatic shipping updates.”\n\n---\n\n## Related components\n\nTo let merchants connect or disconnect third-party services and apps, use the [account connection](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/account-connection) component.\n\n---\n\n## Accessibility\n\nThe `SettingToggle` component is implemented as an HTML `<button>` with the `switch` [ARIA role](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles/switch_role).\nThe components passed as children will automatically be wrapped in a label element describing the `<button>`. Enabling and disabling `SettingToggle` will update the `aria-checked` attribute to `"true"` or `"false"`.\n\nTo learn more about button accessibility, check out the [button](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/actions/button) component documentation.',

          '## Accessibility\n\nSheets provide an opportunity to let merchants dig into more detail on their current task, or access information for their current task in a different way. Although merchants may be able to see content in the sheet and the main page content at the same time, they should only be expected to interact with one or the other at any given time.\n\n### Keyboard support\n\n- Use the `onClose` prop so that the sheet can be closed with the <kbd>esc</kbd> key as well as with button-based controls\n- Use a button to open the sheet\n- When the sheet opens, focus moves to it so merchants who rely on the keyboard and screen readers can access it\n- Focus is kept in the sheet until it is dismissed\n- When the sheet closes, focus moves back to the button that launched it\n\n---\n\n## Responsive behavior\n\nAt small screen sizes, the sheet component enters the page from the bottom of the screen. At larger screen sizes, the sheet component enters the page from the right side of the scren.\n\n---\n\n## Best practices\n\nThe sheet component should:\n\n- Include a heading that summarizes the actions and information in the sheet, for example, More filters\n- Be openable through clear actions, like a link or button\n- Be close-able through clear actions, like Done, the [X] button, and the esc key\n- Include information and actions contextual to the current task\n- Not block merchants from completing their task, like a modal would\n- Not open from within another sheet (only one sheet can be open at a time)\n- Preserve its state—the settings and actions won’t reset when it’s closed\n\nThe sheet component is best used in cases where the merchant needs to see elements behind it, and for that reason it uses a transparent backdrop. The backdrop is a full screen overlay which closes its parent component when pressed.\n\n---\n\n## Related components\n\n- To offer an action before merchants can go to the next step in the flow, use the [modal component](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/overlays/modal)\n- To present a small amount of content or a menu of actions in a non-blocking overlay, use the [popover component](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/overlays/popover)',

          '## Best practices\n\nBanners should:\n\n- Be used thoughtfully and sparingly for only the most important information.\n- Not be used to call attention to what a merchant needs to do in the UI instead of making the action clear in the UI itself.\n- Not be the primary entry point to information or actions merchants need on a regular basis.\n- Be dismissible unless they contain critical information or an important step merchants need to take.\n- Use the default icon for `success`, `info`, `warning` and `critical` statuses. If the status icon is changed, use only [major icons](https://polaris.shopify.com/design/icons#major-icons-20-20).\n- Remove the status icon only in scenarios where it takes up too much space, such as very small breakpoints or in side navigation cards.\n\n### Placement\n\nBanners should be placed in the appropriate context:\n\n- Banners relevant to an entire page should be placed at the top of that page, below the page header. They should occupy the full width of the content area.\n- Banners related to a section of a page (like a card, popover, or modal) should be placed inside that section, below any section heading. These banners have less spacing and a pared-back design to fit within a content context.\n- Banners related to an element more specific that a section should be placed immediately above or below that element.\n\n---\n\n## Content guidelines\n\nBanners should:\n\n- Focus on a single theme, piece of information, or required action to avoid overwhelming merchants.\n- Be concise and scannable—merchants shouldn’t need to spend a lot of time figuring out what they need to know and do.\n- Be limited to a few important calls to action with no more than one primary action.\n- Not be used for marketing information or upsell—[use callout cards](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/callout-card) instead.\n\nTo learn about writing helpful and accessible error message text, see the guidelines for [error messages](https://polaris.shopify.com/patterns/error-messages).\n\n### Title\n\nBanner titles should follow the content guidelines for [headings and subheadings](https://polaris.shopify.com/content/actionable-language#headings-and-subheadings).\n\n### Body content\n\nBody content should:\n\n- Be concise: keep content to 1 to 2 sentences where possible\n- Clarify the benefit of the main task\n- Be written in sentence case and use appropriate punctuation\n- Avoid repeating the heading\n- Explain how to resolve the issue, particularly for warning and critical banners\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\nYour online store has a maximum of 20 themes. Delete unused themes to add more.\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\nYou have reached your theme limit. Your online store has reached its maximum of 20 themes. To add more themes, delete themes you’re no longer using.\n\n</div></div>\n\n### Button and links\n\nButtons and links should be:\n\n- Clear and predictable: merchants should be able to anticipate what will happen when they click a button. Never deceive merchants by mislabeling a button.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\nBuy shipping label\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\nBuy\n\n</div></div>\n\n- Action-led: buttons should always lead with a strong verb that encourages action. To provide enough context to merchants use the {verb}+{noun} format on buttons except in the case of common actions like Save, Close, Cancel, or OK.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\nActivate Apple Pay\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\nTry Apple Pay\n\n</div></div>\n\n- Scannable: avoid unnecessary words and articles such as the, an, or a.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\nAdd menu item\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\nAdd a menu item\n\n</div></div>\n\nLink text should:\n\n- Set the expectation of where merchants will be taken\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\nOrder #001\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\nOrder\n\n</div></div>\n\n- Use consistent content to label navigation. For example, if a navigational link leads to a page called Orders, label the link Orders.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\nPayments\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\nFinance section\n\n</div></div>\n\n### Secondary body content\n\nBody content should be:\n\n- Actionable: start sentences with imperative verbs when telling merchants what actions are available to them (especially something new). Don’t use permissive language like “you can”.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\nGet performance data for all your sales channels.\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\nNow you can get performance data for all your sales channels.\n\n</div></div>\n\n- Structured for merchant success: always put the most critical information first.\n- Clear: use the verb “need” to help merchants understand when they’re required to do something.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\nTo buy a shipping label, you need to enter the total weight of your shipment, including packaging.\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\nTo buy a shipping label, you must enter the total weight of your shipment, including packaging.\n\n</div></div>\n\n---\n\n## Related components\n\n- To inform merchants about a new feature or opportunity, [use callout cards](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/callout-card)\n- To group similar concepts together in the interface, [use a card](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/layout-and-structure/alpha-card)\n\n---\n\n## Accessibility\n\nBanners provide context and assist workflows for merchants with disabilities.\n\n- Critical and warning banners have a `role=”alert”` and are announced by assistive technologies when they appear.\n- All other banners have a `role=”status”` and are read after any critical announcements.\n- All banners have an `aria-live` attribute and are announced by assistive technologies when their content is updated. These announcements can be disabled by using the prop `stopAnnouncements`.\n- Banners use `aria-describedby` to describe their purpose to assistive technologies when they’re announced or receive focus. If a banner has a `title`, then the title content is used for the `aria-describedby`. If the banner doesn’t have a `title`, then all of the banner content is used for the `aria-describedby`.\n- Banner containers have a `tabindex=”0”` and display a visible keyboard focus indicator. Because of this, merchants can discover banners while tabbing through forms or other interactions, and developers can programmatically move focus to banners.\n- Banners use a combination of [icons](https://polaris.shopify.com/design/icons) and [colors](https://polaris.shopify.com/design/colors) to show their meaning and level of importance to merchants.\n\n### Error notifications in forms\n\n#### Critical banners\n\nWhen merchants submit long or complex forms with errors, use a critical banner to summarize what went wrong. Place the banner at the top of the form and move focus to the banner when the form is submitted. This allows all merchants to move through the form in a logical order to correct the issues.\n\n#### Inline errors\n\nAlways include [inline error](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/inline-error) messages for specific form fields so that merchants know what to do in context as they correct their mistakes.\n\nTo learn about creating helpful and accessible error message text, see the guidelines for [error messages](https://polaris.shopify.com/patterns/error-messages).\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- Put banners close in context to the problem they’re referring to\n- Give banners with a lot of information a clear title that summarizes their content\n- Move focus to banners if they’re relevant to the merchant’s current workflow and need to be addressed immediately\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- Move focus to banners if they appear on page load, or outside the merchant’s current workflow\n- Use warning or critical (`role=”alert”`) banners to convey information that the merchant doesn’t need to address immediately\n\n</div></div>',

          '## Required components\n\nThe toast component must be wrapped in the [frame](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/frame) component.\n\n---\n\n## Best practices\n\nToast should:\n\n- Be used for short messages to confirm an action\n- Not go over 3 words\n- Rarely be used for error messages\n\nWhen to use:\n\n- For success messages\n- Only for non-critical errors that are relevant in the moment and can be explained in 3 words. For example, if there’s an internet connection issue, the toast would say, Internet disconnected.\n\nWhen not to use:\n\n- Avoid using toast for error messages. Always try to use a banner to prominently inform merchants about persistent errors.\n\n---\n\n## Content guidelines\n\n### Message\n\nToast messages should be:\n\n- Short and affirmative\n- Written in the pattern of: noun + verb\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- Product updated\n- Collection added\n- Customer updated\n- Internet disconnected\n- Connection timed out\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- No internet connection\n- Can’t charge negative tax rates\n- Your online store has a maximum of 20 themes. Delete unused themes to add more.\n- Your product has been successfully updated\n- We were unable to save the customer\n- Your Order was Archived Today\n- Discount: Saved successfully\n\n</div></div>\n\n### Toast with action\n\nOnly include an action in toast if the same action is available elsewhere on the page. For example:\n\n- If merchants need to reload a section, offer the call to action [Reload] in the toast. If they miss the toast message, they can also refresh the entire page.\n- If merchants delete an image, offer the option to [Undo] the deletion. If they miss it in the toast message, they can still retrieve it from somewhere else.\n\nAction should:\n\n- Keep the action label short, preferably 1 verb.\n- Not have actions, like [Cancel], for dismissing toast. The [X] to dismiss is already included in the component.\n- Be used with a duration of at least 10,000 milliseconds for accessibility.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- Undo\n- Change\n- Edit\n- View\n- Retry\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- OK\n- Got it\n- Cancel product\n- Continue to collection\n- Dismiss\n\n</div></div>\n\n---\n\n## Related components\n\n- To present a small amount of content or a menu of actions in a non-blocking overlay, [use the popover component](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/overlays/popover)\n- To communicate a change or condition that needs the merchant’s attention within the context of a page, [use the banner component](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/feedback-indicators/banner)\n\n---\n\n## Accessibility\n\nThe content of the toast component is implemented as an ARIA live region using `aria-live="polite"`. When the toast appears, screen readers should announce the toast text after any other more pressing announcements.\n\nAvoid using toast for critical information that merchants need to act on immediately. Toast might be difficult for merchants with low vision or low dexterity to access because it:\n\n- Disappears automatically\n- Can’t be easily accessed with the keyboard\n- Might appear outside the proximity of the merchant’s current focus\n\n### Toast with action\n\nMake sure that merchants can also accomplish the action in the toast another way, since the toast action may be difficult to access for some merchants. If the toast action is not available somewhere else on the page, for example a retry action that reloads a section, it should have a fallback action, for example a browser refresh.\n\nToast with action should persist for at least 10,000 milliseconds to give the merchant enough time to act on it.',

Doing this is important for [accessibility](https://polaris.shopify.com/foundations/accessibility) because it allows screen readers to describe what’s in the image to people who may not be able to see it.\n\nFor avatars, we recommend using a format that describes what will show in the image:\n\n- `alt="Person’s name"` if the avatar represents a person\n- `alt="Business’s name"` if the avatar represents a business\n- `alt=""` if the name of the person/business appears next to the avatar as text\n\n---\n\n## Related components\n\n- To show a thumbnail for an object rather than a person or business, [use the thumbnail component](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/thumbnail)\n\n---\n\n## Accessibility\n\n### Structure\n\nThe avatar component uses a generated scalable vector graphics (SVG) file, which can cause challenges for merchants that use assistive technologies. To create a standard experience, the `<img>` is hidden from assistive technologies by using an empty `alt` attribute, and replaced with a `<span>` that has `role=”img”`.\n\n### Labeling\n\nThe avatar component represents content, and should have a text equivalent for merchants using assistive technologies. By default, the value of the `name` prop is used for the alternative text. If different text would be more accurate, use the `accessibilityLabel` prop to replace the value provided by `name`.',

Don’t use permissive language like “you can”.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\nGet performance data for all your sales channels.\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\nNow you can get performance data for all your sales channels.\n\n</div></div>\n\n- Structured for merchant success: always put the most critical information first\n- Clear: use the verb “need” to help merchants understand when they’re required to do something\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\nTo buy a shipping label, you need to enter the total weight of your shipment, including packaging.\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\nTo buy a shipping label, you must enter the total weight of your shipment, including packaging.\n\n</div></div>\n\n### Call to action\n\nButtons should be:\n\nClear and predictable: merchants should be able to anticipate what will happen when they click a button. Never deceive merchants by mislabeling a button.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\nBuy shipping label\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\nBuy\n\n</div></div>\n\n- Action-led: buttons should always lead with a strong verb that encourages action. To provide enough context to merchants use the {verb}+{noun} format on buttons except in the case of common actions like Save, Close, Cancel, or OK.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\nView shipping settings\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\nView your settings\n\n</div></div>\n\n- Scannable: avoid unnecessary words and articles such as the, an, or a.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\nAdd menu item\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\nAdd a menu item\n\n</div></div>\n\n---\n\n## Related components\n\n- To group similar concepts and tasks together, [use the card component](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/layout-and-structure/alpha-card)\n- To create page-level layout, [use the layout component](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/layout-and-structure/layout)\n- To explain a feature that merchants haven’t tried yet, [use the empty state component](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/layout-and-structure/empty-state)\n\n---\n\n## Accessibility\n\nThe required `title` prop gives the callout card a level 2 heading (`<h2>`). This helps with readability and provides structure to screen reader users.\n\nIllustrations included in callout cards are implemented as decorative images with empty `alt` attributes (`alt=""` ) so that they’re skipped by screen readers.\n\nUse [actionable language](https://polaris.shopify.com/content/actionable-language#navigation) to ensure that the purpose of the callout card is clear to all merchants, including those with issues related to reading and language.',

They should:\n\n- Describe or explain what’s in the empty state title or item title\n- Be conversational: include articles such as the, a, and an\n\n### Primary action\n\nButtons are used for the most important actions you want merchants to take.\nThey should be:\n\n- Clear and predictable: merchants should be able to anticipate what will happen when they click a button. Never deceive merchants by using misleading titles.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- Create order\n- Buy shipping label\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- New order\n- Buy\n\n</div></div>\n\n- Action-led: buttons should always lead with a strong verb that encourages action. To provide enough context to merchants use the {verb}+{noun} format on buttons except in the case of common actions like Save, Close, Cancel, or OK.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- Activate Apple Pay\n- View shipping settings\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- Try Apple Pay\n- View your settings\n\n</div></div>\n\n- Scannable: avoid unnecessary words and articles such as the, an, or a.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- Add menu item\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- Add a menu item\n\n</div></div>\n\n### Secondary action\n\nSecondary actions are used for less important actions such as “Learn more” or “Close” buttons.

Labels are not help text, and they shouldn’t be used to provide instruction, but they should be meaningful and clearly indicate what is expected. Labels should be:\n\n- Placed above or beside the form field\n- Short and succinct (1–3 words)\n- Written in sentence case (the first word capitalized, the rest lowercase)\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- Email address\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- What is your email address?\n\n</div></div>\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- Phone number\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- My phone number is:\n\n</div></div>\n\n### Help text\n\nHelp text provides extra guidance to people filling out a form field.

          '## Best practices\n\nCards should:\n\n- Use headings that set clear expectations about the card’s purpose\n- Prioritize information so the content merchants most need to know comes first\n- Stick to single user flows or break more complicated flows into multiple sections\n- Avoid too many call-to-action buttons or links and only one primary call to action per card\n- Use calls to action on the bottom of the card for next steps and use the space in the upper right corner of the card for persistent, optional actions (such as an Edit link)\n\n---\n\n## Content guidelines\n\n### Title\n\nCard titles should follow the content guidelines for [headings and subheadings](https://polaris.shopify.com/content/actionable-language#headings-and-subheadings).\n\n### Body content\n\nBody content should be:\n\n- Actionable: start sentences with imperative verbs when telling merchants what actions are available to them (especially something new). Don’t use permissive language like “you can”.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\nGet performance for all your sales channels.\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\nNow you can get performance data for all your sales channels.\n\n</div></div>\n\n- Structured for merchant success: always put the most critical information first.\n- Clear: use the verb “need” to help merchants understand when they’re required to do something.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\nTo buy a shipping label, you need to enter the total weight of your shipment, including packaging.\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\nTo buy a shipping label, you must enter the total weight of your shipment, including packaging.\n\n</div></div>\n\n### Call-to-action button\n\nButtons should be:\n\n- Clear and predictable: merchants should be able to anticipate what will happen when they click a button. Never deceive merchants by mislabeling a button.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- Create order\n- Buy shipping label\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- New order\n- Buy\n\n</div></div>\n\nAction-led: buttons should always lead with a strong verb that encourages action. To provide enough context to merchants use the {verb}+{noun} format on buttons except in the case of common actions like Save, Close, Cancel, or OK.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- Activate Apple Pay\n- View shipping settings\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- Try Apple Pay\n- View your settings\n\n</div></div>\n\nScannable: Avoid unnecessary words and articles such as the, an, or a.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\nAdd menu item\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\nAdd a menu item\n\n</div></div>\n\n### Section titles\n\nSection titles should be:\n\n- Informative: they should label the type of content grouped in the body content below\n- Like headings: follow the same content guidelines as when you’re writing headings\n\n### Action links\n\nLinks should be:\n\n- Used for secondary or persistent actions: links should be used to represent lower priority actions than buttons, or persistent actions that merchants may take at any time (such as a persistent Edit link).\n- Clearly labeled: merchants should not need to guess where they’ll end up if they click on an action link. Never use “click here” as a link because it doesn’t set expectations about what’s next.\n- Similar to buttons: Follow the same content guidelines as when you’re writing text for buttons.\n\n---\n\n## Related components\n\n- To create page-level layout, [use the layout component](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/layout)\n- To highlight a Shopify feature, [use the callout card component](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/callout-card)\n\n---\n\n## Accessibility\n\nThe required `title` prop gives the card a level 2 heading (`<h2>`). This helps with readability and provides structure to screen reader users.\n\nIf you use the `subdued` prop on a card or section, make sure that the card or section `title` conveys the reason for using `subdued`. This ensures that merchants with low vision, including those who use screen readers, can identify that the content is inactive or less important.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n```\n<LegacyCard title="Deactivated staff accounts" sectioned subdued>\n  <List>\n    <List.Item>Felix Crafford</List.Item>\n    <List.Item>Ezequiel Manno</List.Item>\n  </List>\n</LegacyCard>\n```\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n```\n<LegacyCard title="Staff accounts" sectioned subdued>\n  <List>\n    <List.Item>Felix Crafford</List.Item>\n    <List.Item>Ezequiel Manno</List.Item>\n  </List>\n</LegacyCard>\n```\n\n</div></div>',

          '## Best practices\n\nThe page component should:\n\n- Always provide a title for the page header.\n- Always provide breadcrumbs when a page has a parent page.\n- Be organized around a primary activity. If that primary activity is a single action, provide it as a primary button in the page header.\n- Provide other page-level actions as secondary actions in the page header.\n- When the page represents an object of a certain type, provide pagination links to the previous and next object of the same type.\n\n---\n\n## Content guidelines\n\n### Title\n\nTitles should:\n\n- Describe the page in as few words as possible.\n- Be the name of the object type (pluralized) when the page is a list of objects. For a list of orders, the page title should be “Orders”.\n- Not be truncated.\n\n### App icon\n\nApp icons should:\n\n- Provide their app icon\n- Only be provided for pages that are part of a Shopify app\n\n### Breadcrumbs\n\nThe content of each breadcrumb link should be the title of the page to which it links.\n\n### Page header actions\n\nPage header action labels should be:\n\n- Clear and predictable: merchants should be able to anticipate what will happen when they click a page action. Never deceive merchants by mislabeling an action.\n\n- Action-led: they should always lead with a strong verb that encourages action. To provide enough context to merchants, use the {verb}+{noun} format.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- Create order\n- View in Postmates\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- Create\n- Postmates deliveries\n\n</div></div>\n\n- Short: for secondary actions, when the noun represents the same object as the page itself, a verb alone may be used. If there is ambiguity (such as with the verb “Cancel”), always use the {verb}+{noun} format.\n\n  In the context of the orders list page:\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- Import\n- Export\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- Import orders\n- Export orders\n\n</div></div>\n\n- Scannable: avoid unnecessary words and articles such as the, an, or a.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\nAdd menu item\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\nAdd a menu item\n\n</div></div>\n\n---\n\n## Related components\n\n- To lay out the content within a page, use the [layout component](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/layout-and-structure/layout)\n- To add pagination within the context of a list or other page content, use the [pagination component](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/navigation/pagination)\n- To add primary and secondary calls to action at the bottom of a page, see the [page actions component](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/actions/page-actions)\n\n## Related patterns\n\n- [App settings layout](/patterns/app-settings-layout)\n- [Resource details layout](/patterns/resource-details-layout)',

          'Resource lists can also:\n\n- Support [customized list items](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/resource-item)\n- Include bulk actions so merchants can act on multiple objects at once\n- Support sorting and [filtering](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/filters) of long lists\n- Be paired with pagination to make long lists digestible\n\n---\n\n## Build\n\nUsing a resource list in a project involves combining the following components and subcomponents:\n\n- ResourceList\n- [ResourceItem](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/resource-item) or a customized list item\n- [Filters](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/filters) (optional)\n- Pagination component (optional)\n\nThe resource list component provides the UI elements for list sorting, filtering, and pagination, but doesn’t provide the logic for these operations. When a sort option is changed, filter added, or second page requested, you’ll need to handle that event (including any network requests) and then update the component with new props.\n\n---\n\n## Purpose\n\nShopify is organized around objects that represent merchants businesses, like customers, products, and orders. Each individual order, for example, is given a dedicated page that can be linked to. In Shopify, we call these types of objects _resources_, and we call the object’s dedicated page its _details page_.\n\n### Problem\n\nTake orders as an example. Merchants may have a lot of them. They need a way to scan their orders, see what state they’re in and find out which ones need action first. In other words, they need a way find an individual order, call up more information about it, and take action on it.\n\n### Solution\n\nResource lists function as:\n\n- A content format, presenting a set of individual resources in a compact form\n- A system for taking action on one or more individual resources\n- A way to navigate to an individual resource’s details page\n\nBecause a details page displays all the content and actions for an individual resource, you can think of a resource list as a summary of these details pages. In this way resource lists bridge a middle level in Shopify’s navigation hierarchy.\n\n![Schematic showing content from a details page being surfaced on a resource list](/images/list-surfacing-show@2x.png)\n\n#### A resource list isn’t a data table\n\nOn wide screens, a resource list often looks like a table, especially if some content is aligned in columns. Despite this, resource lists and data tables have different purposes.\n\nA data table is a form of data visualization. It works best to present highly structured data for comparison and analysis.\n\nIf your use case is more about visualizing or analyzing data, use the [data table component](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/data-table). If your use case is more about finding and taking action on objects, use a resource list.\n\n---\n\n## Best practices\n\nResource lists can live in many places in Shopify. You could include a short resource list in a card summarizing recent marketing activities. You could also dedicate an entire page to a resource list like Shopify’s main products list.\n\nResource lists should:\n\n- Have items that perform an action when clicked. The action should navigate to the resource’s details page or otherwise provide more detail about the item.\n- [Customize the content and layout](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/resource-item) of their list items to support merchants’ needs.\n- Support sorting if the list can be long, and especially if different merchant tasks benefit from different sort orders.\n- Support [filtering](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/filters) if the list can be long.\n- Paginate when the current list contains more than 50 items.\n- Use the [skeleton page](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/skeleton-page) component on initial page load for the rest of the page if the loading prop is true and items are processing.\n\nResource lists can optionally:\n\n- Provide bulk actions for tasks that are often applied to many list items at once. For example, merchants may want to add the same tag to a large number of products.\n\n---\n\n## Content guidelines\n\nResource lists should:\n\n- Identify the type of resource, usually with a heading\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- Products\n- Showing 50 products\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- _No heading_\n\n</div></div>\n\n- Indicate when not all members of a resource are being shown. For a card summarizing and linking to recently purchased products:\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- Popular products this week\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- Products\n\n</div></div>\n\n- Follow the verb + noun formula for bulk actions\n\n- Follow the [content guidelines for filter options and applied filters](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/filters#content-guidelines)\n\n---\n\n## Related components\n\n- To present structured data for comparison and analysis, like when helping merchants to gain insights or review analytics, use the [data table component](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/data-table)\n- To display a simple list of related content, [use the list component](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/lists/list)',

          '## Best practices\n\n### Buttons versus links\n\nLinks are used primarily for navigation, and usually appear within or directly following a sentence.\n\nButtons are used primarily for actions, such as “Add”, “Close”, “Cancel”, or “Save”. Plain buttons, which look similar to links, are used for less important or less commonly used actions, such as “view shipping settings”.\n\nThe HTML that renders for the `Button` and `Link` components carries meaning. Using these components intentionally and consistently results in:\n\n- a more inclusive experience for assistive technology users\n- a more cohesive visual experience for sighted users\n- products that are easier to maintain at scale\n\n### Open a new tab only when necessary\n\nUse default links whenever possible to avoid disorienting merchants and causing accessibility problems by opening a new tab.\n\nExternal links should be used when merchants are:\n\n- Performing a task or workflow, like creating a product\n- Navigating to a page outside of the Shopify admin\n\n### No icon\n\nAvoid using the [external icon](/icons?icon=ExternalMinor&q=external), as it can add unnecessary visual load inside a sentence or when accompanied by other content. Instead, add clarity to external links through clear link text and predictable placement of the link in a merchant’s workflow.\n\nEdge cases: External icons should not be used to indicate a new tab or window is being opened. However, they may be used sparingly in features where symbols help merchants scan and pick from a list of several kinds of navigation options, like the admin\'s global search results.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\nUse as a standalone, identifying icon only\n\n![Shopify admin search search results with an example of the external link icon being used as a decorative element](/images/external-link-icon-decorative@2x.png)\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\nAvoid using the icon beside link text\n\n![Shopify admin page with an example of an external link to the Shopify help center with no icon](/images/external-link-dont-example@2x.png)\n\n</div></div>\n\n### Unstyled links\n\nIf the existing link styles don’t meet the needs of your project, then use the `UnstyledLink` component to create a custom link style.\n\n---\n\n## Content guidelines\n\nThe link component should follow the content guidelines for [links](https://polaris.shopify.com/content/actionable-language#links).\n\n---\n\n## Related components\n\n- For actions that don’t appear within or directly following a sentence, use the [button component](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/actions/button)\n\n---\n\n## Accessibility\n\nUse the `url` prop to give the link component a valid `href` value. This allows the element to be identified as a link to assistive technologies and gives it default keyboard support.\n\nThe Link component is underlined to give interactive elements a shape. This allows links to not rely on color from being the only way users can tell if an element is interactive.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- Remove the link underline when link is repeated in a list or navigation\n- Use underlines for links when used inline content\n\n```jsx\n<p>\n  Learn more about <Link>Fraud Protect</Link>.\n</p>\n```\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- Remove underlines when the user cannot determine it\'s interactivity\n\n```jsx\n<Link removeUnderline>Learn more about Fraud Protect.</Link>\n```\n\n</div></div>\n\n### Submitting data\n\nMerchants generally expect links to navigate, and not to submit data or take action. If you need a component that doesn’t have a URL associated with it, then use the [button component](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/actions/button) instead.\n\n### Labeling\n\nGive links text that clearly describes their purpose.\n\nThe `accessibilityLabel` prop adds an `aria-label` attribute to the link, which can be accessed by assistive technologies like screen readers. Typically, this label text replaces the visible text on the link for merchants who use assistive technology.\n\nTo provide consistency and clarity:\n\n- Use the same text for links that navigate to the same content\n- Use different text for links that navigate to different content\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n```jsx\n<Link url="https://help.shopify.com/manual">fulfilling orders</Link>\n```\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n```jsx\n<Link>fulfilling orders</Link>\n```\n\n</div></div>\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n```jsx\n/* Somewhere in the code: */\n<Link url="https://help.shopify.com/manual">fulfilling orders</Link>\n\n/* Elsewhere in the code: */\n<Link url="https://help.shopify.com/manual">fulfilling orders</Link>\n```\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n```jsx\n/* Somewhere in the code: */\n<Link url="https://help.shopify.com/manual">fulfilling orders</Link>\n\n/* Elsewhere in the code: */\n<Link url="https://help.shopify.com/manual">order fulfillment section</Link>\n```\n\n</div></div>\n\n### Keyboard support\n\nLinks use browser defaults for keyboard interaction.\n\n- Give links keyboard focus with the <kbd>tab</kbd> key (or <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>tab</kbd> when tabbing backwards)\n- Activate links with the <kbd>enter</kbd>/<kbd>return</kbd> key',

          '## Required components\n\nThe navigation component must be passed to the [frame](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/frame) component. The mobile version of the navigation component appears in the [top bar](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/top-bar) component.\n\n---\n\n## Best practices\n\nThe navigation component should:\n\n- Contain primary navigation items that perform an action when clicked. Each action should navigate to a URL or trigger another action like a modal overlay.\n- Only use secondary actions for supplementary actions to the primary actions.\n- Provide a non-primary link or action as a secondary action to a section or an item.\n- Group navigation items into sections based on related categories.\n- Use a section title to clarify the category of a section.\n- Use a major icon for item actions.\n- Use a minor icon for secondary actions.\n- Use the provided navigation section component to group navigation items.\n- Not add additional components, like [badge](/components/feedback-indicators/badge), in navigation items. Example: Don‘t add the [New badge](/patterns-legacy/new-badge).\n\n---\n\n## Content guidelines\n\nNavigation should:\n\n- Use sentence case for primary and secondary navigation items\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- Online store\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- Online Store\n\n</div></div>\n\n- Use as few words as possible to describe each item label\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- Products\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- Products in your store\n\n</div></div>\n\n- Use all caps for section labels\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- SALES CHANNELS\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- Sales channels\n\n</div></div>\n\n---\n\n## Navigation section\n\nA navigation section groups together related navigation items. Navigation sections can be clarified by a heading. Merchants can use a section to easily find navigation items within a specific category.\n\n### Section properties\n\n| Prop      | Type                   | Description                                                                                   |\n| --------- | ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| items     | [Item[]](#type-item)   | A collection of navigation items to be rendered inside the section                            |\n| icon      | IconProps[\'source\']    | An icon to be displayed next to the section title                                             |\n| title     | string                 | A string property providing a title for the navigation section                                |\n| fill      | boolean                | A boolean property indicating whether the section should take up all vertical space available |\n| rollup    | [Rollup](#type-rollup) | An object determining the collapsing behavior of the navigation section                       |\n| action    | [Action](#type-action) | Renders an icon-only action as a supplementary action next to the section title               |\n| separator | boolean                | A boolean property indicating whether the section should have a visual separator              |\n\n### Navigation section item\n\nThe content of the navigation component consists of navigation items.

For example, the tabs for the orders section are:\n\n  - All\n  - Open\n  - Unfulfilled\n  - Unpaid\n\nThe tabs for the gift cards section are:\n\n- All\n- New\n- Partially used\n- Used\n- Disabled\n\nAnd for the customers section, the tabs are:\n\n- All\n- New\n- Returning\n- Abandoned checkouts\n- Email subscribers\n\nWhere possible, follow this pattern when writing tabs.',

          '## Best practices\n\nUse modals for confirmations and conditional changes. They should be thought of as temporary and not be used for information or actions that need to live on in the UI in a persistent way. Don’t use modals to display complex forms or large amounts of information.\n\nModals should:\n\n- Require that merchants take an action.\n- Close when merchants press the `X` button, the `Cancel` button, the <kbd>Esc</kbd> key, or when merchants click or tap the area outside the modal.\n- Not have more than two buttons (primary and secondary) at the bottom. This prevents unclear action hierarchy and crowding on mobile screens. Since modals are for focused tasks, they should have focused actions. In some cases however, a [tertiary action](#tertiary-actions) may be appropriate.\n\n---\n\n## Content guidelines\n\n### Title\n\nModal titles should:\n\n- Use a clear {verb}+{noun} question or statement\n- Follow the content guidelines for [headings and subheadings](https://polaris.shopify.com/content/actionable-language#headings-and-subheadings)\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- Edit email address\n- Delete customer?\n- Discard unsaved changes?\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- Edit the email address for this order\n- Are you sure you want to delete customer?\n- Discard?\n\n</div></div>\n\n### Body content\n\nBody content should be:\n\n- Actionable: start sentences with imperative verbs when telling a merchant what actions are available to them (especially something new).

This will avoid known issues a screen reader may have with keyboard support once focus is moved off the activator.\n\nWeb browsers assign a default value of \'menu\' to the `aria-haspopup` role. You can use the prop `ariaHaspopup` to specify a value. Screen readers may fail to send focus to the `Popover` content when they expect the content to be adjacent to the element with `aria-haspopup` in the DOM tree. In this scenario, it is recommended not to provide the `ariaHaspopup` prop.\n\n### Keyboard support\n\n- When a popover opens, focus moves to the first focusable element or to the popover container\n- Once focus is in the popover, merchants can access controls in the popover using the <kbd>tab</kbd> key (and <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>tab</kbd> backwards) and standard keystrokes for interacting\n- Merchants can dismiss the popover by tabbing out of it, pressing the <kbd>esc</kbd> key, or clicking outside of it\n- When the popover is closed, focus returns to the element that launched it',

However, you can change the position with the `preferredPosition` prop.\n\nAutocomplete features can be challenging for merchants with visual, motor, and cognitive disabilities. Even when they’re built using best practices, these features can be difficult to use with some assistive technologies. Merchants should always be able to search, enter data, or perform other activities without relying on the autocomplete.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\nUse autocomplete as progressive enhancement to make the interface easier to use for most merchants.\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\nRequire that merchants make a selection from the autocomplete to complete a task.\n\n</div></div>\n\n### Keyboard support\n\n- Give the autocomplete text input keyboard focus with the <kbd>tab</kbd> key (or <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>tab</kbd> when tabbing backwards)\n- Access the list of options with the up and down arrow keys\n- Select an option that has focus with the <kbd>enter</kbd>/<kbd>return</kbd> key',

          '## Best practices\n\nCheckboxes should:\n\n- Work independently from each other. Selecting one checkbox shouldn’t change the selection status of another checkbox in the list. The exception is when a checkbox is used to make a bulk selection of multiple items.\n- Be framed positively. For example, say “Publish store” instead of “Hide store”.\n- Always have a label when used to activate or deactivate a setting.\n- Be listed according to a logical order, whether it’s alphabetical, numerical, time-based, or some other clear system.\n- Link to more information or include a subtitle as required to provide more explanation. Don’t rely on tooltips to explain a checkbox.\n\n---\n\n## Content guidelines\n\n### Lists with checkboxes\n\nLists that use checkboxes should:\n\n- Start with a capital letter\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- Option 1\n- Option 2\n- Option 3\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- option 1\n- option 2\n- option 3\n\n</div></div>\n\n- Not use commas or semicolons at the end of each line\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- Red\n- Yellow\n- Blue\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- Red;\n- Yellow;\n- Blue.\n\n</div></div>\n\n- In the rare case where the checkbox is asking merchants to agree to terms or service, use the first person\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\nI agree to the Terms of Service.\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\nYou agree to the Terms of Service\n\n</div></div>\n\n---\n\n## Related components\n\n- To present a list of options where merchants can only make a single choice, [use the radio button component](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/radio-button)\n- To display a list of related content, [use the choice list component](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/choice-list)\n- To create an ungrouped list, [use the content list component](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/lists/list)\n\n---\n\n## Accessibility\n\nScreen readers convey the state of the checkbox automatically.\n\n- Use the `disabled` prop to apply the HTML `disabled` attribute to the checkbox `<input>`. This prevents merchants from being able to interact with the checkbox, and conveys its inactive state to assistive technologies.\n- Use the `id` prop to provide a unique `id` attribute value for the checkbox. If an `id` isn’t provided, then the component generates one. All checkboxes must have unique `id` values to work correctly with assistive technologies.\n- Setting `checked="indeterminate"` conveys the state of the checkbox using `aria-checked="mixed"`.\n- Setting the `ariaControls` prop conveys the ID of the element whose contents or presence are controlled by the checkbox to screen reader users with the `aria-controls` attribute.\n\n### Labeling\n\n- The required `label` prop conveys the purpose of the checkbox to all merchants\n- Use the `labelHidden` prop to visually hide the label but make it available to assistive technologies\n- When you provide help text via the `helpText` prop or an inline error message via the `error` prop, the help or error content is conveyed to screen reader users with the `aria-describedby` attribute\n\n### Keyboard support\n\n- Move focus to each checkbox using the <kbd>tab</kbd> key (or <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>tab</kbd> when tabbing backwards)\n- To interact with the checkbox when it has keyboard focus, press the <kbd>space</kbd> key',

          '## Anatomy\n\n![A diagram of the Combobox component showing the smaller primitive components it is composed of.](/images/combobox-anatomy.png)\n\nA combobox is made up of the following:\n\n1. **TextField**: A text input that activates a popover displaying a list of options. As merchants type in the text field, the list of options is filtered by the input value. Options replace or add to the input value when selected.\n2. **Popover**: An overlay containing a list of options.\n3. **Listbox**: A list of options to filter and select or deselect.\n4. **Listbox.Option**: The individual options to select or deselect. Check out the [listbox component documentation](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/lists/listbox) to learn how to compose it with various content.\n\n---\n\n## Best practices\n\nThe `Combobox` component should:\n\n- Be clearly labeled so the merchant knows what kind of options will be available\n- Not be used within a popover\n- Indicate a loading state to the merchant while option data is being populated\n- Order items in an intentional way so it’s easy for the merchant to find a specific value\n\n---\n\n## Content guidelines\n\nThe input field for `Combobox` should follow the [content guidelines](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/selection-and-input/text-field) for text fields.\n\n---\n\n## Sorting and filtering\n\n### Sorting\n\nItem order should be intentional. Order them so it’s easy for the merchant to find a specific value. Some ways you can do this:\n\n- Sort options in alphabetical order\n- Display options based on how frequently the merchant selects an option\n\nIf multiple options can be selected, move selected items to the top of the list. If this doesn’t work for your context, you can override this behavior.\n\n### Filtering\n\n- By default, menu items are filtered based on whether or not they match the value of the textfield.\n- Filters are **not** case-sensitive by default.\n- You can apply custom filtering logic if the default behavior doesn’t make sense for your use case.\n\n---\n\n## Patterns\n\n### Tags autocomplete\n\nThe tag multi-select input enables merchants to efficiently add or remove tags from a resource, like a product or an order. It uses the inline autocomplete combobox pattern to present merchants with an editable list of tags to browse and select from.\n\n---\n\n## Related components\n\n- For an input field without suggested options, [use the text field component](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/selection-and-input/text-field)\n- For a list of selectable options not linked to an input field, [use the list box component](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/lists/listbox)\n\n---\n\n## Accessibility\n\n### Structure\n\nThe `Combobox` component is based on the [ARIA 1.2 combobox pattern](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/#combobox). It is a combination of a single-line `TextField` and a `Popover`. The current implementation expects a [`Listbox`](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/lists/listbox) component to be used.\n\nThe `Combobox` popover displays below the text field or other control by default so it is easy for merchants to discover and use. However, you can change the position with the `preferredPosition` prop.\n\n`Combobox` features can be challenging for merchants with visual, motor, and cognitive disabilities. Even when they’re built using best practices, these features can be difficult to use with some assistive technologies. Merchants should always be able to search, enter data, or perform other activities without relying on the combobox.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- Use combobox as progressive enhancement to make the interface easier to use for most merchants.\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- Require that merchants make a selection from the combobox to complete a task.\n\n</div></div>\n\n### Keyboard support\n\n- Give the combobox\'s text input keyboard focus with the <kbd>tab</kbd> key (or <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>tab</kbd> when tabbing backwards)',

Avoid scenarios where multiple forms on a single page can be edited at the same time. If specific sections of a page need to be independently editable, use an Edit button to launch a [modal dialog](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/overlays/modal) for each section where changes can be made and saved.\n\n---\n\n## Content guidelines\n\nMessages in the contextual save bar component should be informative, clear, and concise. They should follow the {adjective}+{noun} pattern. Don’t use full sentences.\n\nThe standard message content is\n\n- “Unsaved changes” when editing existing content\n- “Unsaved {resource name}” when creating a new object\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- Unsaved changes\n- Unsaved product\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- You have unsaved changes\n- Red and white striped shirt not yet saved\n\n</div></div>\n\nActions in the contextual save bar component should consist of a strong verb that encourages action. They should not include a noun.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- Save\n- Discard\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- Save changes\n- Discard changes\n\n</div></div>\n\n---\n\n## Related components\n\n- To wrap your entire application, [use the frame component](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/frame)\n- To build the outer wrapper of a page, including page title and associated actions, [use the page component](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/layout-and-structure/page)\n- To wrap form elements and handle the submission of a form, [use the form component](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/form)',

          "## Best practices\n\n### Drop zone\n\nDrop zones should:\n\n- Inform merchants when the file(s) can’t be uploaded:\n  - When possible, use validation errors on drag to detect and explain things like file size limits or file types accepted.\n  - Use the [banner component](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/feedback-indicators/banner) with a critical status to communicate errors that happen on the server.\n- Provide feedback once the file(s) have been dropped and uploading begins.\n- For convenience, allow files to be dropped anywhere on the page by enabling `dropOnPage`.\n- Provide a file upload button to allow merchants to select files for upload in a traditional way. Do this by using the `DropZone.FileUpload` subcomponent.\n\n### Validation errors\n\nThe drop zone component validates file type by default. File types you wish to accept can be defined by editing the `accept` property. This component also accepts custom validations using the `customValidator` property. When validation fails, the component sets itself to error mode.\n\n---\n\n## Content guidelines\n\n### Client-side validation error messages\n\nClient-side validation errors give instant feedback.\n\nValidation error messages should be:\n\n- Explicit: help merchants understand why their file can’t be uploaded and what they should change to successfully upload their file\n- In sentence case: capitalize only the first word in the message\n- Concise: use simple, clear language that can be read at a glance. For example:\n\n`File size must be less than 20MB`\n\n`File type must be .gif, .jpg, .png or .svg`\n\n### Server-side upload error messages\n\nServer-side upload errors give feedback after file submission.\n\nUpload error messages should:\n\n- Be displayed as a [banner](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/feedback-indicators/banner) with a critical status\n- Show the name of the file(s) that were not uploaded successfully\n- Describe why the file(s) couldn’t be uploaded and what merchants should change to upload their file successfully, as seen below\n\n```\nThe following images couldn’t be uploaded:\n\n* “keep-it-real.png” is too large. Try a file size less than 20MB.\n* “realer-than-real.zip” is not supported. File type must be .gif, .jpg, .png or .svg.\n* “so-so-real.png” was interrupted due to weak network connection, [retry upload](#)\n```\n\n---\n\n## Drop zone file upload\n\nUse file upload with the drop zone component to let merchants select files for upload in a traditional way.\n\n### File upload properties\n\n| Prop        | Type   | Description                        | Default                   |\n| ----------- | ------ | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------- |\n| actionTitle | string | String that appears in file upload | 'Add file'                |\n| actionHint  | string | String that appears in file upload | 'or drop files to upload' |\n\n---\n\n## Related components\n\n- To provide context to upload errors when they occur, use the [banner component](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/feedback-indicators/banner)\n- To provide feedback during file upload, use the [spinner component](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/spinner)\n\n---\n\n## Accessibility\n\nThe drop zone component builds on the native HTML `<input type=\"upload\">` element. It includes a visual`<button>` as well as a drag and drop area that can receive keyboard focus.\n\n### Keyboard support\n\nTo upload a file with the keyboard, merchants can interact with the drag-and-drop region.\n\n- To give the input keyboard focus, use the <kbd>tab</kbd> key (or <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>tab</kbd> when tabbing backwards)\n- To activate the input, use the <kbd>enter</kbd>/<kbd>return</kbd> or <kbd>space</kbd> keys",

          'Merchants use filters to:\n\n- view different subsets of items in a list or table\n- filter by typing into a text field\n- filter by selecting filters or promoted filters\n\nThe way that merchants interact with filters depends on the components that you decide to incorporate. In its simplest form, filters includes a text field and a set of filters, which can be displayed in different ways. For example, you could show promoted filters and a More button that opens a [sheet](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/deprecated/sheet) containing more filters. What the filters are and how they’re exposed to merchants is flexible.\n\n---\n\n## Accessibility\n\nThe filters component relies on the accessibility features of multiple other components:\n\n- [Text field](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/selection-and-input/text-field)\n- [Button](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/actions/button)\n- [Popover](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/overlays/popover)\n- [Sheet](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/deprecated/sheet)\n- [Collapsible](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/collapsible)\n\n### Maintain accessibility with custom features\n\nSince custom HTML can be passed to the component for additional actions, ensure that the filtering system you build is accessible as a whole.\n\nAll merchants must:\n\n- be able to identify and understand labels for all controls\n- be notified of state changes\n- be able to complete all actions with the keyboard\n\n---\n\n## Best practices\n\nThe filters component should:\n\n- help reduce merchant effort by promoting the filtering categories that are most commonly used\n- include no more than 2 or 3 promoted filters\n- consider small screen sizes when designing the interface for each filter and the total number filters to include\n- use children only for content that’s related or relevant to filtering\n\n---\n\n## Content guidelines\n\n### Text field\n\nThe text field should be clearly labeled so it’s obvious to merchants what they should enter into the field.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- Filter orders\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- Enter text here\n\n</div></div>\n\n### Filter badges\n\nUse the name of the filter if the purpose of the name is clear on its own. For example, when you see a filter badge that reads **Fulfilled**, it’s intuitive that it falls under the Fulfillment status category.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- Fulfilled, Unfulfilled\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- Fulfillment: Fulfilled, Unfulfilled\n\n</div></div>\n\nIf the filter name is ambiguous on its own, add a descriptive word related to the status. For example, **Low** doesn’t make sense out of context. Add the word “risk” so that merchants know it’s from the Risk category.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- High risk, Low risk\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- High, Low\n\n</div></div>\n\nGroup tags from the same category together.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- (Unfulfilled, Fulfilled)\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- (Unfulfilled) (fulfilled)\n\n</div></div>\n\nIf all tag pills selected: truncate in the middle\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- Paid, par… unpaid\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- All payment status filters selected, Paid, unpa…\n\n</div></div>',

This helps to support assistive technologies that use different interaction and browse modes.\n\nForms can have only one submit button and it must be at the end of the form. By default, buttons added to the form are given a `type` attribute set to `button` to avoid conflicts. To make a button the submit button instead (`type="submit"`), set the `submit` prop on the button.\n\n### Keyboard support\n\nBy default, the `implicitSubmit` prop is set to `true`. This allows merchants to submit the form with the <kbd>enter</kbd>/<kbd>return</kbd> key when focus is in any text field inside the form. This provides a shortcut for keyboard users. If this behavior doesn’t fit the form, then set the prop to `false`.',

          'Merchants use filters to:\n\n- Create different subsets of list items\n- Search list items by typing a query into the text input\n- Sort list items by column\n\nThe way that merchants interact with index filters depends on the components that you decide to incorporate. It supports configuration of a search query input, sorting options, and one or more filters that can be made up of different inputs.\n\nMerchants use the tabs in index tables to:\n\n- Control which view is visible\n- Edit the applied filters and search terms of a view\n- Create, rename, duplicate, or delete views\n\nYou can create views and control which actions can be performed on a particular view.\n\n## Anatomy\n\n![A diagram of the IndexFilters component showing the components it is composed of.](/images/index-filters-anatomy.png)\nIndex filters are made up of the following:\n\n1. **Tabs**: A list of saved views. Each tab represents a subset of the list that has been sorted, filtered, and or queried and saved with a unique name. New views can be created directly from the tab list, or by editing the filters, query, or sort selection of an existing view and saving it as new.\n2. **Search and filter, and sort buttons**: The search and filter button allows merchants to toggle the index table from "View" mode to "Filter" mode. When clicked, the button reveals the search field and the filters that allow merchants to edit or create saved views. The sort button activates a popover displaying a list of options merchants can choose from to sort the list items. Merchants can also choose whether the list should be sorted in ascending or descending order.\n3. **Filters**: A set of useful ways to narrow down the list based on the common actions merchants may need to take on the data. The filters should present merchants with form inputs that help them include or exclude list items from the view based on their data.\n4. **Action buttons**: Primary and secondary actions that a merchant can take on the current view. The primary action will always be either "Save" or "Save as" depending on whether the view is mutable, and the secondary action will always be "Cancel".\n\n---\n\n## Accessibility\n\nThe filters component relies on the accessibility features of several other components:\n\n- [Popover](/components/overlays/popover)\n- [ChoiceList](/components/selection-and-input/choice-list)\n- [Modal](/components/overlays/modal)\n- [Tabs](/components/navigation/tabs)\n- [Tooltip](/components/overlays/tooltip)\n\n### Maintain accessibility with custom features\n\nSince custom HTML can be passed to the component for additional actions, ensure that the filtering system you build is accessible as a whole.\n\nAll merchants must be able to:\n\n- Identify and understand the labels of all controls\n- Be notified of state changes as they use the filter controls\n- Complete all actions using a keyboard\n\n---\n\n## Best practices\n\nIndex filters should:\n\n- Reduce merchant effort by promoting the filtering categories that are most commonly used\n- Include no more than 2 or 3 promoted filters\n- Consider small screen sizes when designing the interface for each filter and the total number filters to include\n- Use children only for content that’s related or relevant to filtering\n\n---\n\n## Content guidelines\n\n### Text field\n\nThe text field should be clearly labeled so it’s obvious to merchants what they should enter into the field.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- Filter orders\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- Enter text here\n\n</div></div>\n\n### Filter badges\n\nUse the name of the filter if the purpose of the name is clear on its own. For example, when you see a filter badge that reads **Fulfilled**, it’s intuitive that it falls under the Fulfillment status category.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- Fulfilled, Unfulfilled\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- Fulfillment: Fulfilled, Unfulfilled\n\n</div></div>\n\nIf the filter name is ambiguous on its own, add a descriptive word related to the status. For example, **Low** doesn’t make sense out of context. Add the word “risk” so that merchants know it’s from the Risk category.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- High risk, Low risk\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- High, Low\n\n</div></div>\n\nGroup tags from the same category together.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- (Unfulfilled, Fulfilled)\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- (Unfulfilled) (fulfilled)\n\n</div></div>\n\nIf all tag pills selected: truncate in the middle\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- Paid, par… unpaid\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- All payment status filters selected, Paid, unpa…\n\n</div></div>',

All radio buttons must have unique `id` values to work correctly with assistive technologies.\n\n### Labeling\n\n- The required `label` prop conveys the purpose of the radio button to all merchants\n- Use the `labelHidden` prop to visually hide the label but make it available to assistive technologies\n- When you provide help text via the `helpText` prop or an inline error message via the `error` prop, the help or error content is conveyed to screen reader users with the `aria-describedby` attribute\n\n### Keyboard support\n\n- Move focus to the radio button group using the <kbd>tab</kbd> key (or <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>tab</kbd> when tabbing backwards)\n- Use the up and down arrow keys to change which radio button is selected',

          '## Best practices\n\nRange sliders should:\n\n- Always be used with a label, even if that label is `hidden`.\n- When a label is visible, it should clearly communicate the purpose of the range input and its values (min, max, step, value)\n- Be labeled as “Optional” when you need to request input that’s not required\n- Validate input as soon as merchants have finished interacting with a field (but not before)\n- Always be used with two text field components when range slider has dual thumbs, to provide accessible alternatives to both the lower and upper thumbs\n\n---\n\n## Content guidelines\n\n### Range label\n\nA label is a short description of the requested input. Labels are not instructional text but they should be meaningful and clearly indicate what is expected. Labels should be:\n\n- Placed above the form field\n- Short and succinct (1–3 words)\n- Written in sentence case (the first word capitalized, the rest lowercase)\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- Saturation percentage\n- Banner width\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- What is the saturation value?\n- The banner width is:\n\n</div></div>\n\n### Designating optional fields\n\nTry to only ask for information that’s required. If you need to ask merchants to provide optional information, mark the field optional by placing the text “(optional)” at the end of the field’s label. Don’t mark required fields with asterisks.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- Banner width (optional)\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- Banner width\n\n</div></div>\n\n### Help text\n\nHelp text provides extra guidance or instruction to people filling out a form field. It can also be used to clarify how the information will be used. As with all form content, help text should be succinct and easy to read.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- Video duration is calculated in seconds\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- Example: 134 seconds\n\n</div></div>\n\n### Validation error messages\n\nError messages should:\n\n- Clearly explain what went wrong and how to fix it\n- Be short and concise, no more than a single sentence\n- Use [passive voice](https://polaris.shopify.com/content/grammar-and-mechanics) so merchants don’t feel like they’re being blamed for the error\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- Video duration is required\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- You didn’t enter a duration\n\n</div></div>\n\n---\n\n## Related components\n\n- To collect a number value as a text input, [use the text field component](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/selection-and-input/text-field)\n\n---\n\n## Accessibility\n\nThe range slider provides a large click and tap target for the slider thumbs. Merchants can also tap or click on the slider track to move the closest slider thumb.\n\n### Single-thumb slider\n\nThe default range slider component uses the [ARIA 1.1 slider pattern](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/#slider) to build upon the default HTML `<input type="range">`. The required `label` prop provides a label for the field that’s conveyed to assistive technologies when it receives focus. When the slider is used, the `value` prop should update visually and programmatically to reflect the current value.\n\nTo consistently provide the current value to assistive technologies, use the `min` and `max` props to provide the minimum and maximum values for the slider.\n\n### Dual-thumb slider\n\nThe dual-thumb range slider component uses the [ARIA 1.1 slider (multi-thumb) pattern](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/#slidertwothumb). However, the pattern isn’t consistently supported by screen readers, especially on mobile devices. Because of this, it’s best to pair the dual-thumb slider with a set of text fields for each value, or to provide another accessible method for entering information.\n\n### Keyboard\n\n- To move focus to a slider thumb, press the <kbd>tab</kbd> key to move forward and or <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>tab</kbd> to move backward\n- When a thumb has focus, use the up and down or left and right arrow keys to move the thumb and update the associated value.',

          '## Best practices\n\nText fields should:\n\n- Be clearly labeled so it’s obvious to merchants what they should enter into the field\n- Be labeled as “Optional” when you need to request input that’s not required\n- Only ask for information that’s really needed\n- Validate input as soon as merchants have finished interacting with a field (but not before)\n\n### Autocomplete\n\nThe autocomplete attribute in an `input` field controls two types of browser behavior:\n\n1. **Browser autofill**: a feature that automatically populates form fields with previously-saved information, such as passwords, addresses, and credit card data.\n\n- Autofill is an important feature for our users. Google has found that ["users complete forms up to 30% faster"](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2015/06/checkout-faster-with-autofill?hl=en) when using autofill.\n- The WHATWG has a list of supported autofill values for the `autocomplete` attribute. [Review the section "4.10.18.7 Autofill"](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/form-control-infrastructure.html#autofill) for all the input types and their corresponding autocomplete attribute values.\n\n2. **Browser autocomplete** - a feature that displays previously submitted values for that field.\n\n- When this is on for a field, a user is presented a list with previously submitted values for the input\n\n**Recommendation**\n\n> Always add an autocomplete attribute and value to inputs if the type is: color, date, datetime-local, email, month, number, password, range, search, tel, text, time, url, or week.\n\n#### Turning autofill/autocomplete off\n\nEven if you do not want the browser to autofill a user\'s information, it is recommended you still have an autocomplete attribute with the value off or nope.\n\nUnfortunately, [not all browsers support](https://caniuse.com/input-autocomplete-onoff) or respect autocomplete="off". This makes things challenging. Chrome, for example, [has a long outstanding bug](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=468153) and won\'t add support for off for now.\n\n| Browser | Support for `autocomplete="off"` | Details                                                                                                                                                             |\n| ------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Chrome  | Partial                          | Intentionally ignores `off` value when the user uses the browser\'s autofill functionality. [See bug](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=468153). |\n| Safari  | Partial                          | Ignores `off` value for `username`, `email` and `password` fields.                                                                                                  |\n| Firefox | Partial                          | Ignores `off` value for login forms. [See bug](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=956906).                                                                |\n| Edge    | Partial                          | Intentionally ignores `off` value when the user uses the browser\'s autofill functionality.                                                                          |\n\nChrome does seem to turn autocomplete off when using the value nope (or any non valid string). However, we have seen some inconsistencies even with that support.\n\n**Recommendation (Chrome only)**\n\n- Turning off both **autofill** and **browser autocomplete** (previously submitted values) in Chrome\n  - Use `autocomplete=nope` and also **must have a `name` attribute**.\n- Turning off **browser autocomplete** (previously submitted values) in Chrome\n  - If you don\'t have `name` attribute and the field is not a typical autofill input (address, email, etc), use `autocomplete=off`.\n\n### Virtual keyboard\n\n![Examples of different number keyboards set with inputMode](/images/virtual-keyboards.png)\n\nThe `inputMode` property should be set to select the appropriate virtual keyboard for the type of data expected to be entered by the user. Above are examples of different number keyboards set with `inputMode`.\n\n---\n\n## Content guidelines\n\nFor text field content guidelines, reference the [text fields experience](https://polaris.shopify.com/patterns/text-fields) page.\n\n---\n\n## Related components\n\n- To lay out the elements in a responsive form, [use the form layout component](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/form-layout)\n- To describe an invalid form input with a separate validation error, [use the inline error component](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/inline-error)\n- It’s common to [use a select component](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/select) connected to the left or right of a text field.\n\n---\n\n## Accessibility\n\n### Structure\n\nScreen readers convey information about text fields automatically through native HTML.\n\n- Use the `disabled` prop to add the HTML `disabled` attribute to the text field.\n- Use the `readOnly` prop to add the HTML `readonly` attribute to the text field.\n- If you use the `type` prop, then some assistive technologies adapt the software keyboard to the current task. This helps merchants with mobility, vision, and cognitive issues to enter information more easily.\n\nUse the `id` prop to provide a unique `id` attribute value for the text field. If you don\'t provide an `id`, then the component generates one automatically. All text fields need to have unique `id` values.\n\n### Labeling\n\nThe `label` prop is required to convey the purpose of the checkbox to all merchants.\n\nIf there are separate visual cues that convey the purpose of the text field to sighted merchants, then the label can be visually hidden with the `labelHidden` prop.\n\nWhen you provide help text via the `helpText` prop or an inline error message via the `error` prop, the help or error content is conveyed to screen reader users with the `aria-describedby` attribute. This attribute causes the content to be read along with the label, either immediately or after a short delay.\n\nUse the `placeholder` prop to provide additional instructions. However, don’t rely on placeholders alone since the content isn’t always conveyed to all merchants.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- Use the label to provide instructions critical to using the text field\n- Use help text and placeholder text to provide additional, non-critical instructions\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\nUse the placeholder to provide information that’s required to use the text field.\n\n</div></div>\n\n### Keyboard support\n\nText fields have standard keyboard support.\n\n- Merchants who rely on the keyboard expect to move focus to each text field using the <kbd>tab</kbd> key (or <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>tab</kbd> when tabbing backwards)\n- If the `type` is set to `number`, then merchants can use the up and down arrow keys to adjust the value typed into the field when hovering over or focusing the field to make the arrows appear\n- Using the `disabled` prop will prevent the text field from receive keyboard focus or inputs\n- The `readOnly` prop allows focus on the text field but prevents input or editing\n- The `inputMode` prop can be used to bring up a relevant keyboard for merchants on mobile; it’s passed down to the input as an [`inputmode` attribute](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/inputmode)\n\n#### Automatically focusing\n\nAlthough you can use the `autoFocus` prop to automatically move focus to the text field, it’s generally best to avoid focusing on fields automatically. The `autoFocus` prop is set to `false` by default and should only be used in cases where it won’t force focus to skip other controls or content of equal or greater importance.',

          '## Best practices\n\nData tables should:\n\n- Show values across multiple categories and measures.\n- Allow for filtering and ordering when comparison is not a priority.\n- Help merchants visualize and scan many values from an entire data set.\n- Help merchants find other values in the data hierarchy through use of links.\n- Minimize clutter by only including values that supports the data’s purpose.\n- Include a summary row to surface the column totals.\n- Not include calculations within the summary row.\n- Wrap instead of truncate content. This is because if row titles start with the same word, they’ll all appear the same when truncated.\n- Not to be used for an actionable list of items that link to details pages. For this functionality, use the [resource list component](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/resource-list).\n\n### Alignment\n\nColumn content types are built into the component props so the following alignment rules are followed:\n\n- Numerical = Right aligned\n- Textual data = Left aligned\n- Align headers with their related data\n- Don’t center align\n\n---\n\n## Content guidelines\n\nHeaders should:\n\n- Be informative and descriptive\n- Concise and scannable\n- Include units of measurement symbols so they aren’t repeated throughout the columns\n- Use sentence case (first word capitalized, rest lowercase)\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\nTemperature °C\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\nTemperature\n\n</div></div>\n\nColumn content should:\n\n- Be concise and scannable\n- Not include units of measurement symbols (put those symbols in the headers)\n- Use sentence case (first word capitalized, rest lowercase)\n\n### Decimals\n\nKeep decimals consistent. For example, don’t use 3 decimals in one row and 2 in others.\n\n---\n\n## Related components\n\n- To create an actionable list of related items that link to details pages, such as a list of customers, use the [resource list component](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/resource-list).\n\n---\n\n## Accessibility\n\n### Structure\n\nNative HTML tables provide a large amount of structural information to screen reader users. Merchants who rely on screen readers can navigate tables and identify relationships between data cells (`<td>`) and headers (`<th>`) using keys specific to their screen reader.\n\nSortable tables use the `aria-sort` attribute to convey which columns are sortable (and in what direction). They also use `aria-label` on sorting buttons to convey what activating the button will do.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\nUse tables for tabular data.\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\nUse tables for layout. For a table-like layout that doesn’t use table HTML elements, use the [resource list component](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/resource-list).\n\n</div></div>\n\n### Keyboard support\n\nSorting controls for the data table component are implemented with native HTML buttons.\n\n- Give buttons keyboard focus with the <kbd>tab</kbd> key (or <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>tab</kbd> when tabbing backwards)\n- Activate buttons with the <kbd>enter</kbd>/<kbd>return</kbd> and <kbd>space</kbd> keys',

When a sort option is changed, filter added, or second page requested, you’ll need to handle that event (including any network requests) and then update the component with new props.\n\n---\n\n## Purpose\n\nShopify is organized around objects that represent merchants businesses, like customers, products, and orders. Each individual order, for example, is given a dedicated page that can be linked to. In Shopify, we call these types of objects _resources_, and we call the object’s dedicated page its _details page_.\n\n### Problem\n\nTake orders as an example. Merchants may have a lot of them. They need a way to scan their orders, view the different attributes on each order, and find out which ones need action first. In other words, they need a way find an individual order, call up more information about it, and take action on it.\n\n### Solution\n\nIndex tables function as:\n\n- A content format, presenting a set of individual resources with multiple columns of information for each\n- A system for taking action on one or more individual resources\n- A way to navigate to an individual resource’s details page\n\nBecause a details page displays all the content and actions for an individual resource, you can think of a resource list as a summary of these details pages. In this way resource lists bridge a middle level in Shopify’s navigation hierarchy.\n\n---\n\n## Best practices\n\nIndex tables should:\n\n- Have items that perform an action when clicked. The action should navigate to the resource’s details page or otherwise provide more detail about the item.\n- [Customize the content and layout](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/resource-item) of their items rows to surface information to support merchants’ needs.\n- Support sorting if the list can be long, and especially if different merchant tasks benefit from different sort orders.\n- Support [filtering](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/filters) if the list can be long.\n- Paginate when the current list contains more than 50 items.\n- Use the [skeleton page](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/skeleton-page) component on initial page load for the rest of the page if the loading prop is true and items are processing.\n- Numeric cells and titles should be right aligned with the [Text](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/text) component\n- Numeric cells should use the numeric style with the [Text](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/text) component\n\nIndex tables can optionally:\n\n- Provide bulk actions for tasks that are often applied to many list items at once. For example, merchants may want to add the same tag to a large number of products.\n\n---\n\n## Content guidelines\n\nIndex tables should:\n\n- Identify the type of resource, usually with a heading\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- Products\n- Showing 50 products\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- _No heading_\n\n</div></div>\n\n- Indicate when not all members of a resource are being shown. For a card summarizing and linking to recently purchased products:\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- Popular products this week\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- Products\n\n</div></div>\n\n- Follow the verb + noun formula for bulk actions\n\n- Follow the [content guidelines for filter options and applied filters](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/filters#content-guidelines)\n\n---\n\n## IndexTableRow\n\nAn `IndexTableRow` is used to render a row representing an item within an `IndexTable`\n\n### IndexTableRow properties\n\n| Prop     | Type       | Description                                                      |\n| -------- | ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| id       | string     | A unique identifier for the row                                  |\n| selected | boolean    | A boolean property indicating whether the row is selected        |\n| position | number     | The index position of the row                                    |\n| subdued  | boolean    | A boolean property indicating whether the row should be subdued  |\n| status   | RowStatus  | A property indicating whether the row should have a status       |\n| disabled | boolean    | A boolean property indicating whether the row should be disabled |\n| onClick  | () => void | A function which overrides the default click behaviour           |\n\n## IndexTableCell\n\nAn `IndexTableCell` is used to render a single cell within an `IndexTableRow`\n\n### IndexTableCell properties\n\n| Prop      | Type    | Description                                                                      |\n| --------- | ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| flush     | boolean | A boolean property indicating whether the cell should remove the default padding |\n| className | string  | Adds a class to the cell, used for setting widths of a cell                      |\n\n---\n\n## Related components\n\n- To create an actionable list of related items that link to details pages, such as a list of customers, use the [resource list component](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/resource-list)\n- To present structured data for comparison and analysis, like when helping merchants to gain insights or review analytics, use the [data table component](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/data-table)\n- To display a simple list of related content, [use the list component](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/lists/list)',

Headings should:\n\n- Clearly describe the section of interface they refer to\n- Highlight the most important concept or piece of information merchants need to know\n- Sit at the top of the section of interface they’re referring to\n\n### Captions\n\nCaptions use the `bodySm` Text variant.\n\n- Use for secondary labels in graphs and charts\n- May be used for timestamps in lists of content\n- Don’t use this variant for other cases\n- Don’t use this variant for text longer than a few words\n- Don’t use this variant for aesthetic effect or to break from the standard text size\n\n### Text styles\n\nText styles should be:\n\n- Used when enhancing the text to help merchants understand its meaning\n- Subdued if the text is less important than its surrounding text\n- Warning if the text denotes something that needs attention, or that merchants need to take action on.\n- Semibold for input fields, or for a row total in a price table\n- Paired with symbols, like an arrow or dollar sign, when using success or critical styles\n\n### Visually hidden\n\nVisually hidden text should:\n\n- Not be used if semantic markup can make content understandable to people using assistive technology\n- Be used to provide extra context when semantic markup isn’t enough\n- Be used on any content that is normally present but is being omitted\n- Make sense in context when used with a screen reader\n\n---',

          "## Best practices\n\nThe app provider component is required to use Polaris. Without it, the components in your application will not function correctly. You must wrap the root (the top) of your application in the app provider component.\n\n---\n\n## Using translations\n\nTranslations are provided in the locales folder. When using Polaris, you are able to import translations from all languages supported by the core Shopify product and consume them through the `i18n` prop.\n\nIf a project has only one locale, then you can pass the JSON content from the locale file into `AppProvider`.\n\n```jsx\nimport {AppProvider} from '@shopify/polaris';\n// en.json is English. Replace with fr.json for French, etc\nimport translations from '@shopify/polaris/locales/en.json';\n\nfunction App() {\n  return <AppProvider i18n={translations}>{/* App content */}</AppProvider>;\n}\n```\n\nIf a project supports multiple locales, then load them dynamically using [`@shopify/react-i18n`](https://github.com/Shopify/quilt/tree/master/packages/react-i18n#translation). This ensures that you load only the translations you need.\n\n```jsx\nimport {AppProvider} from '@shopify/polaris';\n// en.json is English. Replace with fr.json for French, etc\nimport translations from '@shopify/polaris/locales/en.json';\nimport {useI18n} from '@shopify/react-i18n';\n\nfunction App() {\n  const [i18n] = useI18n({\n    id: 'Polaris',\n    fallback: translations,\n    translations(locale) {\n      return import(\n        /* webpackChunkName: \"Polaris-i18n\", webpackMode: \"lazy-once\" */ `@shopify/polaris/locales/${locale}.json`\n      ).then((dictionary) => dictionary && dictionary.default);\n    },\n  });\n\n  // i18n.translations is an array of translation dictionaries, where the first\n  // dictionary is the desired language, and the second is the fallback.\n  return (\n    <AppProvider i18n={i18n.translations}>{/* App content */}</AppProvider>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Using linkComponent\n\nBy default Polaris renders `<Link>` elements (and action objects) as `<a>` tags. That works well for simple one-page demos. However for more complex multi-page applications that use a router such as [`react-router`](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web) you will want links to use the components provided by your router. If you don't then every link will be an `<a>` tag and thus trigger a whole page refresh instead of navigating client-side.\n\nThe `linkComponent` prop allows you to customise how links behave within Polaris by allowing you to inject your router's own Link component. The following example demonstrates using react-router's `Link` component.\n\n```jsx\nimport {BrowserRouter, Link as ReactRouterLink} from 'react-router-dom';\n\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    <BrowserRouter>\n      <AppProvider linkComponent={Link}>\n        {/* App content including your <Route> components */}\n      </AppProvider>\n    </BrowserRouter>\n  );\n}\n\nconst IS_EXTERNAL_LINK_REGEX = /^(?:[a-z][a-z\\d+.-]*:|\\/\\/)/;\n\nfunction Link({children, url = '', external, ref, ...rest}) {\n  // react-router only supports links to pages it can handle itself. It does not\n  // support arbirary links, so anything that is not a path-based link should\n  // use a reglar old `a` tag\n  if (external || IS_EXTERNAL_LINK_REGEX.test(url)) {\n    rest.target = '_blank';\n    rest.rel = 'noopener noreferrer';\n    return (\n      <a href={url} {...rest}>\n        {children}\n      </a>\n    );\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <ReactRouterLink to={url} {...rest}>\n      {children}\n    </ReactRouterLink>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Testing components\n\nYou must include Polaris context in your tests when you use Polaris components.\n\nTo make this easier for you, we’ve provided:\n\n- a PolarisTestProvider component to provide the Polaris contexts for you",

For example, don’t assume that your audience is white, has a binary gender, or is nondisabled. Keep in mind that our merchants have intersectional identities, which means they can be from more than one historically-excluded group.\n\nTry to write what you mean without metaphors so your content is easy to understand and localize. If you can’t think of an alternate term, then find another way to write what you want to say.\n\nTest your content with a diverse audience by recruiting merchants from a variety of backgrounds, including historically-excluded groups, and create intersectionality-informed research objectives. Building inclusive experiences starts with involving diverse perspectives early on in the process.\n\n---\n\n## Accessible content\n\nUsing anti-ableist language is just one part of making accessible content at Shopify. Ableist language is content that holds bias towards the nondisabled experience, or discriminates against the disabled community.\n\nAbleism can show up in language directly, as well as in metaphors and euphemisms. For example, “don’t let your marketing efforts fall on deaf ears”. Write what you mean, instead of using analogies, metaphors, or euphemisms.\n\nWrite content that centers around the person, not their disability.\n\n### Words and phrases to avoid\n\nAvoid the following words and phrases.\n\n#### Inspire, inspirational\n\nThis language and narrative around people with disabilities can be othering and reductive. It can also center an abled perception of those with disabilities (For example, “my life’s not that bad, look at them!”).\n\n#### Enable, disable\n\nImplies that disability is a less-desired or negative state.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\nAccounts are deactivated.\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\nAccounts are disabled.\n\n</div></div>\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- On, off\n- Active, inactive\n- Activated, deactivated\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- Enable, enabled\n- Disable, disabled\n\n</div></div>\n\n_Note: Because `disabled` is a valid state for HTML elements, usage of “disabled” is appropriate when talking about specific element states, just not overall feature functionality._\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\nThe checkbox is disabled.\n\n</div></div>\n\n#### Normal, abnormal\n\nThis language can imply that there’s something wrong with anyone outside of the majority.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- Typical\n- Atypical\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- Normal\n- Abnormal\n\n</div></div>\n\n#### Deaf\n\nThis language is often used to equate deafness or hearing impairment with ignorance or insensitivity, rather than refer to deafness itself or the Deaf community. Make sure to only use it when referencing actual deafness or the Deaf community, and not as a metaphor.\n\n#### Blind\n\nAs a metaphor, this can equate lack of vision to ignorance. Only use the term when referencing the disability itself.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- Unaware\n- Gap\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- Blind\n- Blind spot\n\n</div></div>\n\n#### Insane, crazy\n\nThis language can stigmatize people with mental disabilities by using these words as modifiers for “unbelievable” or in a negative context.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- Wild\n- Unbelievable\n- Outrageous\n- Intense\n- Silly\n- Strange\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- Insane\n- Crazy\n\n</div></div>\n\n#### Handicap, handicapped\n\nHandicap implies that the person is the issue, rather than the environment.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- Disability\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- Handicap\n- Handicapped\n\n</div></div>\n\n#### Wheelchair-bound\n\nThis term can reduce a person’s primary identity to using a wheelchair.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- Person who uses a wheelchair\n- Person who uses an accessibility device\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- Wheelchair-bound\n\n</div></div>\n\n#### Suffers from...\n\nThis phrasing implies that having a disability equates to suffering.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- Experiences vision impairment\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- Suffers from vision impairment\n\n</div></div>\n\n#### Just, only\n\nWhen we write a task is “only a few steps”, or this should “just take a minute”, it implies the task is easy, quick, or takes a minimal amount of effort. This can discourage people who might struggle with the task, or might take extra time to complete it.\n\n---\n\n## Anti-racist content\n\nRacist language expresses bias towards or against a particular race, or expresses the belief that some races are inferior to others. Always prioritize our merchants, partners, and buyers experience over perceived barriers to using anti-racist language.\n\n**Tips:**\n\n- Treat non-white or non-Western perspectives the same as white and Western perspectives. Non-Western ideals aren’t “exotic” or “strange”.\n- Write what you mean instead of using an analogy or a metaphor. If you need a metaphor, then don’t use one that denotes “black” or “dark” as bad or negative, versus “white” or “light” as good or positive.\n- Use terms in an appropriate context.\n  - For example, while we typically avoid the use of the term “powwow”, in the following context, it’s appropriate: “Bear Witness is a co-founder of A Tribe Called Red, a Canadian DJ collective that blends hip-hop and EDM with traditional powwow drums and vocals” (from [Vanguard: How A Tribe Called Red Brought Activism to the Dance Floor](https://www.shopify.com/blog/vanguard-a-tribe-called-red)).\n\n<br>\n\n### Words and phrases to avoid\n\nAvoid the following words and phrases.\n\n#### Exotic\n\nConsider why you need to frame someone or something this way. What is “foreign” or “exotic” to you is familiar for someone else.\n\n#### Grandfather in, grandfather clause\n\nThese phrases come from laws meant to circumvent or disenfranchise Black people’s rights. These laws, or “grandfather clauses” originated in the Reconstruction era in the American South.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- Legacy, legacied\n- Exempt\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- Grandfather in, grandfathered in\n- Grandfather clause\n\n</div></div>\n\n#### Powwow\n\nA powwow is a celebration of heritage, art, and community held by Indigenous people, and should only be used to refer to actual powwows. Use other terms to refer to meetings and events that aren’t powwows.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- Meet, meeting\n- Gather, get together\n- Assemble, assembly\n- Regroup\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- Powwow\n\n</div></div>\n\n#### Spirit animal\n\nIndigenous communities use spirit animals as totems and guides. A spirit animal has deep spiritual and cultural meaning, and should only be used in that context. Don’t say spirit animal to mean the animal a non-Indigenous person might identify with the most.\n\n#### Black hat, white hat (hacking)\n\nThese terms imply that “white is good” and “black is bad”.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- Unethical hacking\n- Ethical hacking\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- Black hat\n- White hat\n\n</div></div>\n\n#### Blacklist, whitelist\n\nThese terms enforce the “white is good” and “black is bad” paradigm.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- Denylist, blocklist\n- Allowlist\n- Permit, permitted\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- Blacklist\n- Whitelist\n- Graylist\n\n</div></div>\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\nLearn how to secure a compromised account and reset blocked credentials.\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\nLearn how to secure a compromised account and reset blacklisted credentials.\n\n</div></div>\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\nAdd no-reply[at]shopify.com to your email provider’s allowlist.\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\nAdd no-reply[at]shopify.com to your email provider’s whitelist.\n\n</div></div>\n\n#### Cakewalk\n\nThis term originates from a dance contest where enslaved Black people competed for cake.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\nYou can easily file your your taxes with our latest features.\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\nIt’s a cakewalk to file your taxes with our latest features.\n\n</div></div>\n\n#### Whitespace\n\nThis term refers to communities and places that are predominantly white and that might make non-white people feel restricted or isolated. Avoid using this term except when referring to the named property in CSS.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- New market opportunity/new market space\n- Unmet need/unexplored opportunity\n- Emptyspace\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- Whitespace\n\n</div></div>\n\n#### Long time no see\n\nThis phrase was used to stereotype Indigenous peoples as unintelligent, and shouldn’t be used due to its racist origins.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\nIt’s been a while\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\nLong time no see\n\n</div></div>\n\n---\n\n## Ungendered content\n\nGendered language is language biased towards a particular sex or gender. Language that relies on stereotypes, or makes broad assumptions about its audiences’ sex or gender identities is likely gendered.\n\nUngendered content doesn’t mean avoiding gendered terms—it means being intentional about how you use gendered terms.\n\n**Tips:**\n\n- When a subject is unknown, use “they”, “you”, or “we”.\n- Be conscious of perpetuating stereotypes, like assuming that a merchant might only have a “men’s collection” or a “women’s collection”.\n- Avoid asking for pronouns or gender unless they’re required (or offered).\n- Don’t associate specific qualities with a specific gender, like linking positions of power with men. For example, judge, doctor, lawyer.\n\nAt Shopify, we believe ungendered language expands and improves the ways we talk—it makes us more accurate, more precise, and more inclusive.\n\n### Internationalization\n\nMany languages lack gender-inclusive options, like the pronoun “they” in English. Try to avoid gendered language whenever possible by writing what you want to say in a different way, even if it’s longer. If gender-neutral language isn’t possible, then choose the expression that’s most understandable.\n\nWhen possible, don’t use gendered pronouns. Use the “you” pronoun instead of the third person “she/he”. Find alternatives to gendered adjectives, like indefinite adjectives, substantives, or objects.\n\n### Words and phrases to avoid\n\nAvoid the following words and phrases.\n\n#### Female or male adapter or female or male connector\n\nThese terms reinforce the idea that gender is binary.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- Socket\n- Input\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- Female adaptor\n- Female connector\n\n</div></div>\n\n#### Businessman\n\nThis term can exclude people who aren’t men and reinforce the idea that positions of power are only for men. Use a word that’s gender-neutral and inclusive of all people.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- Businessperson\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- Businessman\n\n</div></div>\n\n#### Manned\n\nThis term excludes people who aren’t men. Use a word that’s gender-neutral and inclusive of all people.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- Staffed\n- Managed\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- Manned\n\n</div></div>\n\n#### Man-made\n\nThis word can exclude people who aren’t men. Use a word that’s gender-neutral and inclusive of all people.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- Artificial\n- Synthetic\n- Manufactured\n- Fabricated\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- Man-made\n\n</div></div>\n\n#### Manpower\n\nThis word can also exclude people who aren’t men.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- Workforce\n- Labor force\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- Manpower\n\n</div></div>\n\n#### Man, woman\n\nThese terms assume a binary gender which might not be the case. Consider how you use these terms and if they’re necessary in that particular context. If you’re listing genders, make sure to include all genders.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- Person\n- Individual\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- Man\n- Woman\n\n</div></div>\n\n#### He/him/his, she/her/hers\n\nThese terms assume a binary gender which might not be the case.

          '## Headings and subheadings\n\nHeadings and subheadings are titles and subtitles that refer to sections of the interface.\n\n### Basic structure\n\nHeadings and subheadings should be:\n\n**Informative and descriptive:**\n\n- Highlight the most important concept or piece of information for merchants\n- Help merchants understand what they’ll find in the section below\n\n**Concise and scannable:**\n\n- Use simple, clear language\n- Keep headings to a single sentence\n- Avoid using punctuation such as periods, commas, or semicolons\n- Write in sentence case (capitalize the first word and proper nouns only)\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- Online store dashboard\n- Custom reports\n- Sell your products in person\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- This is your online store dashboard\n- Custom Reports\n- Sell your products in person!\n\n</div></div>\n\n### Articles\n\nWhether or not to use articles (“the,” “a,” “an”) in headings and subheadings depends on the type of message.\n\n#### Conversational headings\n\nFor more conversational areas of the product, like Home cards, sell pages, and empty states, use articles. It makes the language more approachable and helps people to understand new, complex concepts.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- Secure your account with two-step authentication\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- Two-step authentication\n\n</div></div>\n\n#### Microcopy headings\n\nFor labels, titles, and microcopy, avoid articles to keep content short and actionable. This increases readability and encourages immediate action.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- Create collection\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- Create a collection\n\n</div></div>\n\n---\n\n## Sentences\n\nStart sentences with imperative verbs when telling merchants what actions they can take (especially when introducing something new).\n\nWhen a merchant reads a sentence that starts with an imperative verb it should sound like they’re being instructed what to do. Don’t use permissive language like “you can.”\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\nAdd your first product and see how it looks in your store.\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- Products appear in your store after you add them.\n\n- Add your first product so you can see how it looks in your store.\n\n</div></div>\n\n---\n\n## Buttons\n\n<!--- keywords: buttons, button copy, button text, button content, links, actions, calls to action, call to actions, action-led, action led, scannable, articles, choose , select, choose vs select, select vs choose, need, must, need vs must, must vs need -->\n\nButtons need to be clear and predictable. Merchants should be able to anticipate what will happen when they select a button. Never mislead someone by mislabeling a button.\n\nButtons should always lead with a strong verb that encourages action. To provide enough context to merchants, use the {verb} + {noun} content formula on buttons except in the case of common actions like “Done,” “Close,” “Cancel,” or “OK.”\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- Activate Apple Pay\n- Explore free themes\n- View shipping settings\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- Try Apple Pay\n- Free themes\n- Settings\n\n</div></div>\n\nAlways write button text in sentence case, which means the first word is capitalized and the rest are lowercase (unless a term is a proper noun).\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- Buy new domain\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- Buy New Domain\n\n</div></div>\n\nAvoid unnecessary words and articles such as “the,” “an,” or “a.”\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\nAdd menu item\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\nAdd a menu item\n\n</div></div>\n\n---\n\n## Links\n\nLinks need to be clear and predictable. Merchants should be able to anticipate what will happen when they select a link. Never mislead someone by mislabeling a link.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- Get started with the\n  [Ultimate Guide to Dropshipping](https://www.shopify.com/guides/dropshipping).\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- Want to learn more about dropshipping?\n  [Click here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ).\n\n</div></div>\n\nLinks should never use “click here” or “here” as link text.\n\n### Links in a sentence\n\nLinks in full sentences shouldn’t link the entire sentence, only the text that describes where merchants go when they select the link.\n\nIt’s better for [internationalization](/foundations/internationalization) to have only single terms or small parts of phrases linked. Linking a full phrase is problematic because the word order might change, which would break the link into two parts.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- Learn more about [Fraud Protect](https://www.shopify.com/fraud-protect).\n- Manage the [channels](/) you use to sell products and services.\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- [Learn more about Fraud Protect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ).\n- [Manage the channels](/) you use to sell products and services.\n\n</div></div>\n\n### Links outside of a sentence\n\nLinks that aren’t in full sentences should use the {verb + noun} pattern and not be punctuated, with the exception of question marks.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- [Learn more](/)\n- [Forgot password?](/)\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- [Learn more.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)\n- [Forgot password](/)\n\n</div></div>\n\n---\n\n## Confirmations\n\nConfirmations are presented for actions that can’t be undone or are difficult to undo.\n\nConfirmation messages should:\n\n- Always give merchants the option to either confirm or cancel their action\n- Be used for a single, primary task\n- Keep body content to one line of text and not use more than two calls to action\n\nConfirmation titles should:\n\n- Ask if merchants want to continue, using a concise {verb}+{noun} question\n- Be one sentence and avoid using punctuation, with the exception of question marks\n- Avoid articles (the, a, an) to keep content short and actionable\n- Be written in sentence case (the first word is capitalized, and the rest is lowercase)\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- Discard unsaved changes?\n- Delete 2 collections?\n- Delete Dark Blue Tee?\n- Leave page with unsaved changes?\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- Discard?\n- Are you sure you want to delete?\n- Are you sure you want to delete Dark Blue Tee?\n- This page has unsaved changes are you sure you want to leave?\n\n</div></div>\n\nConfirmation body content should:\n\n- Clearly explain if the action is irreversible or difficult to undo, using [plain language](https://polaris.shopify.com/content/product-content#write-for-a-grade-7-reading-level).\n- Be concise: use only one line of text. Don’t start the sentence with “Are you sure?”\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- This can’t be undone.\n- This will delete all edits since you last saved.\n- Leaving this page will delete all unsaved changes.\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- Are you sure you want to delete the variant Dark Blue Tee/Small/Silk? This action cannot be reversed.\n- If you discard changes, you’ll delete any edits you made since you last saved.\n- If you leave this page, all unsaved changes will be lost. Are you sure you want to leave this page?\n\n</div></div>\n\nConfirmation primary and secondary actions should:\n\n- Be clear and predictable: merchants should be able to anticipate what will happen when they click a button\n- Scannable: avoid unnecessary words and articles such as “the,” “an,” or “a”\n\nSince confirmation messages are placed in modals, the call to action in the title is in close context to the buttons. Because of this, the call to action text on the buttons doesn’t have to follow the {verb}+{noun} pattern. Instead, one word calls to action can be used, for example, [Cancel] \\[Delete].\n\n**Deletions**\n\nBefore merchants can delete objects like collections, transfers, products, and variants, we present them with a confirmation message that has two calls to action, one to [Cancel] and one to [Delete].

It creates challenges for internationalization (for example, right to left languages) and can conflict with mobile design patterns.\n\nDirectional language often indicates a lack of visual or content hierarchy. Whenever possible, keep instructional copy and related actions close together so that directional language isn’t needed.\n\n---\n\n## Save vs. done\n\nUse “Save” when a change is saved immediately to a database and “Done” for [deferred saves](#deferred-saves).\n\n### Saving immediately to a database\n\nUse “Save” as the default for any action that saves immediately to a database.\n\n#### Saving using the context bar component\n\nWhen merchants make changes on a page they’re sometimes presented with a context bar at the top. This context bar displays a status message on the left to indicate the state of the changes, like “Unsaved discount.” Since the status message provides context around the action being taken, the button doesn’t need to follow the common {verb} + {noun} content formula. For example, [Save] instead of [Save product]. In the context bar component, use the verb “Save”.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\nUse the verb “Save” in the context bar\n\n![web context bar](/images/web-context-bar@2x.png)\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- Done\n- Apply\n- Save discount\n\n</div></div>\n\nStatus messages in the context bar should be descriptive and follow the {adjective} + {noun} content formula.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- Unsaved discount\n- Unsaved product\n- Unsaved customer\n- Unsaved shipping zone\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- Unsaved changes\n\n</div></div>\n\n#### Saving in modals and sheets\n\nUse the verb “Save” in modals and sheets when saving directly to the database.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\nUse the verb “Save” in modals and sheets\n\n![web save modal in edit state](/images/web-edit-save@2x.png)\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- Edit\n- Done\n- Apply\n\n</div></div>\n\n#### Saving at the bottom of a page\n\nUse the {Save} + {noun} content formula when a save action doesn’t have the surrounding context of a modal or context bar. This applies to the save action at the bottom of pages.\n\nFor example, the action at the bottom of the Create discount page uses [Save discount]:\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n![web save page action](/images/web-page-actions@2x.png)\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- Create discount\n- Save\n- Done\n- Apply\n\n</div></div>\n\n### Deferred saves\n\nSometimes, when merchants confirm a set of changes inside a modal or sheet, these changes are applied as unsaved changes to the current page. In other words, the changes made weren’t immediately saved to the database. When this happens, don’t use the verb “Save” as the call to action because it would be misleading.\n\nUse the adjective “Done” for deferred saves. When the modal or sheet closes, then merchants can save all of the changes they made.\n\nMost deferred saves happen when confirming changes in Add, Edit, Manage, and Select modals and sheets.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n![deferred save modal with done button](/images/add-done@2x.png)\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- Add\n- Edit\n- Manage\n- Select\n- Apply\n- Save\n\n</div></div>\n\n### Datepickers\n\nUse the adjective “Done” for datepickers.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n![datepicker with done button](/images/datepicker@2x.png)\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- Apply\n- Select\n- Save\n\n</div></div>\n\n---\n\n## Close vs. accept\n\nUse the verb “Close” when merchants need to confirm they’ve read something, but aren’t required to legally accept terms of service before continuing. For example, use “Close” when presenting a security notification in a modal or sheet.\n\nDon\'t use "OK". "OK" is an exclamation, not an action. When merchants click the "Close" button, they’re not saying “OK”, they’re doing a specific action.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n![modal with Close button](/images/modal-with-close@2x.png)\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- OK\n- Ok\n- O.k.\n- Okay\n- Done\n- Accept\n- Continue\n\n</div></div>\n\nUse the verb “Accept” when terms of service require legal confirmation before merchants can continue.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\nAccept\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- Ok\n- Done\n- Close\n- Continue\n\n</div></div>\n\n---\n\n## Close vs. cancel\n\nUse the back arrow button as the call to action for modals and screens when:\n\n- the content is in a view-only state\n\nDon’t use “Close” as the call to action when there’s the option for merchants to:\n\n- make any changes to the modal or screen\n- confirm they’ve read something or accept terms of service (see [OK vs. accept](#OK-accept))\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n![web modal with close button](/images/web-close@2x.png)\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- Cancel\n- Exit\n- OK\n\n</div></div>\n\nUse “Cancel” as the option for merchants to back out of any changes made on a page, modal, or sheet. When the cancel button is pressed, changes automatically get discarded. “Cancel” is often paired with “Save” and “Done” actions (and is always placed to the left).\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\nUse the verb “Cancel” as the action for merchants to back out of changes\n\n![web save modal in edit state](/images/web-edit-save@2x.png)\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- Exit\n- Close\n- Done\n\n</div></div>\n\n---\n\n## Select vs. choose\n\nUse the verb “select”:\n\n- When telling merchants to pick something from a limited number of options of the same kind\n- When merchants need to make an easy or obvious decision that doesn’t require deep reflection or analysis\n- For defined lists and dropdown menus\n- When merchants are given the option to pick from a list of already existing objects, like products\n\nPair Select modals and screens with the “Done” call to action.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- Select your country of residence\n- Select image\n- Select countries\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- Select a pricing plan.\n- Choose countries\n\n</div></div>\n\nUse the verb “choose” when:\n\n- Encouraging merchants to make a decision that is more subjective, strategic, emotional, or open-ended\n- Merchants have to pick from a large inventory of items, like themes, or options that require strategic decision making, like pricing plans\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- Choose a theme\n- Choose a pricing plan.\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- Select a theme\n- Select a pricing plan\n- Choose a province.\n- Pick a province.\n- Pick a pricing plan.\n\n</div></div>\n\n---\n\n## Edit vs. manage\n\nUse the verb “edit” when you can change the input of a field (letters, numbers, properties). Place as link text next to the field or area that is being edited. There’s no need for a noun unless it’s unclear what’s being edited.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- In this example, “Edit” is the correct call to action because it opens a modal where merchants update customer contact information ![modal where merchants can edit contact information](/images/edit-do@2x.png)\n  Here are the editing actions that become available after the “Edit” button is selected ![modal where merchants can edit customer information](/images/edit-do2@2x.png)\n- Edit an individual blog post\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- Use “Edit” if multiple actions can be taken after. “Manage” is more suitable.\n- Modify\n\n</div></div>\n\nUse the verb “manage” at a higher level to convey that multiple actions can be done, or sections and settings can be updated. Pair this verb with a noun if it’s in a button or if it’s unclear what is being managed.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- In this example, “Manage” is the correct call to action because it opens a modal where merchants can select channels to display their products ![manage button on the product page in the product availability section](/images/manage-do@2x.png)\n  Here are the options that become available after the “Manage” button is selected ![modal where merchants can select sales channels](/images/manage-do2@2x.png)\n- Manage multiple blog posts and comments\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- Edit\n- Modify\n\n</div></div>\n\n---\n\n## Change vs. switch\n\nUse the verb “change” when merchants can replace an option, but not edit it. For example, they can change an image or theme, but the action doesn’t include editing its properties. Place as link text next to the field or area that is being changed. There’s no need for a noun unless it’s unclear what is being changed.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- Change image ![change button at the bottom of the image display on the slideshow page of the theme editor](/images/change-do@2x.png)\n  Here are the options that become available after the “Change” button is selected ![images library with an upload drop zone](/images/change-do2@2x.png)\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- Use the verb “change” if a selection must be made between only two options\n\n</div></div>\n\nUse the verb “switch” when it’s important for merchants to know what they’re switching between, like users, accounts, locations, or modes. When the switch happens, the previous option is turned off, logged out, or deactivated. Always pair with a noun to prevent confusion.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- ![Title that says, switch from your third party provider to shopify payments, with a card below that says, payment processing rate of 2.4% plus 0.25 euros”](/images/switch-do@2x.png)\n- ![Modal that says, switch locations to ‘new space’? You will only be able to sell inventory set to this location. Tax rates may also change. At the bottom there are two buttons.

Use “view” in buttons, calls to action, and link text.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- View invoices\n- View all {x}\n- View details\n- View report\n- Try clearing your filters to view all results.\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- See invoices\n- See all {x}\n- See details\n- See report\n\n</div></div>\n\nUse the verb “see” in more general, conversational descriptions without a specific call to action.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- Add your first product and see how it looks on your store.\n- Customers will see this name at checkout.\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- Add your first product and view how it looks on your store.\n- Customers will view this name at checkout.\n\n</div></div>\n\n---\n\n## Need vs. must\n\nUse the verb “need” when you’re telling merchants something they’re required to do or should do.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\nTo buy a shipping label, you need to enter the total weight of your shipment, including packaging.\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\nTo buy a shipping label, you must enter the total weight of your shipment, including packaging.\n\n</div></div>\n\n---\n\n## Export vs. download\n\nUse “export” as the call to action when merchants needs to transfer data from Shopify and convert it into a different format.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- Export CSV file\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- Download CSV file\n\n</div></div>\n\nUse “download” as the call to action when merchants need to copy data (of the same format) from Shopify to a computer system.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- Download shipping label\n- Download PDF\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- Export shipping label\n- Export PDF\n\n</div></div>\n\n---\n\n## Import vs. upload\n\nUse “import” as the call to action when merchants need to transfer data and convert it into a different format so it can be used in Shopify.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- Import CSV file\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- Download CSV file\n\n</div></div>\n\nUse “upload” as the call to action when merchants need to copy data of the same format from a computer system into Shopify.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- Upload image\n- Upload file\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- Upload CSV file\n\n</div></div>',

          'Alt text is a text replacement for an image. Generally, it is represented by the alt HTML element attribute `alt="alt text"`.\n\nOften used by people who are blind or have low vision, screen readers announce alt text to explain images. Alt text will also display when images fail to download (for example, there’s an unstable or low-bandwidth network connection).\n\nAlt text should:\n\n- Help visitors navigate the site\n- Provide an inclusive experience\n- Be as short and specific as possible\n- Be contextual to the intended message\n\n---\n\n## Alt text for images\n\nUse alt text when the image conveys valuable information, such as the ability to play a demo video. Even if an image isn’t conveying meaningful information, don’t leave an `<img>` tag without an alt text element. The screen reader may try to read the filename and create a negative experience. Instead, let the screen reader know to ignore the image by setting the alt to an empty string.\n\nAll `<img>` tags need an alt text attribute, even if it’s empty. For example, set an empty alt text attribute using `<img alt="" />`.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n```jsx\n<VideoThumbnail accessibilityLabel="Watch how-to video on Shopify reports." />\n\n<Thumbnail alt="Black choker necklace" />\n\n<Icon accessibilityLabel="" />\n```\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n```jsx\n<VideoThumbnail accessibilityLabel="Screenshot 2022-11-07 at 3.05.55 PM" />\n\n<Thumbnail alt="Sneaker.png" />\n\n<Icon accessibilityLabel="IMG_1206.heic" />\n```\n\n</div></div>\n\n---\n\n## Writing alt text\n\nAlways write alt text in plain text. The average rate of listening to a screen reader is 3x slower than that of an average visual reader. Many screen reader users listen at fast speeds to make up time. When writing alt text, be as brief as possible.\n\n- Be concise. Think about how to write for a small amount of space or a character limit.\n- Use simple words. If you’re stuck on how to replace a complicated word, check this [A-Z list of alternative words](https://www.plainenglish.co.uk/the-a-z-of-alternative-words.html) or these [plain language tips](/content/product-content#write-for-a-7-grade-reading-level). Another good resource is the [Hemingway editor](https://hemingwayapp.com/).\n- Avoid needless words. If a phrase is still understandable without a specific word, remove it.\n- Remove articles like "a, an, one of," etc. whenever possible. Alt text has different grammatical rules. "Filler words" that assist understanding in speech can get in the way in alt text.\n- Avoid using "image of" or "photograph" unless the type of image is relevant to the context. Screenreaders already announce images with use of the `<img>` attribute.\n- Avoid punctuation like `!!` and emoji like 🥰. Screen readers will announce these as "exclamation point, exclamation point" and "smiling face with three hearts." Use other punctuation marks as you regularly would, such as commas, or periods at the ends of the sentences. The screen-reader will react with a brief pause.\n- Only use acronyms you are confident your audience will understand. If using an acronym, write it with spaces in-between, like "Y M C A." Otherwise, most screen readers will try to read the acronym as a word.\n- Write in the [active voice](/content/grammar-and-mechanics#basics) when possible.\n\n---\n\n## Alt text in context\n\nIt can be tricky to decide whether an image needs alt text or should be ignored by screen readers. Ask yourself:\n\n- Is it interactive?\n- Does this image convey information that isn’t given elsewhere?\n- Does the context of the image communicate anything?\n\nThe same image may have different alt text depending on what it conveys.\n\nFor example, if you’re using a photo of sneakers purely decoratively as the hero image for a blog, tell screen readers to skip it.\n\nIf you’re using the photo as an example of a certain type of sneaker mentioned in the blog, then convey relevant information about the image. For example, "High-top sneaker with gum soles."\n\nBut if you’re using this image in a product listing, ensure shoppers know the important details of what they are buying, such as "Converse Chuck Taylor All Star Classic Black."\n\n### Situations that need alt text\n\n#### Icons\n\n[Icons](/components/images-and-icons/icon) that could be misinterpreted need an explanation, so use the Polaris `accessibilityLabel` prop or the `aria-label` HTML attribute. For interactive icons, don’t describe the image ("magnifying glass"). Instead, describe the action ("search").\n\n```jsx\n<Button accessibilityLabel="search" onClick={() => search()}>\n  <Icon source={SearchMajor} accessibilityLabel="" />\n</Button>\n```\n\n#### Actions\n\nWrite [clear and predictable](https://polaris.shopify.com/content/actionable-language#links) link text. If space constraints require you to write calls to action that are unclear where they take you (like "Learn more" and "Apply now"), give further indication of where merchants will be sent after they select.\n\n```jsx\n<Link\n  url="https://www.shopify.com/protect"\n  accessibilityLabel="Learn more about Fraud Protect"\n>\n  Learn more\n</Link>\n```\n\n#### Complex images\n\nImages with more complexity need some consideration. For example, groups of image elements can be described by a single text, rather than announcing each individual element.\n\n```jsx\n<div role="img" aria-labelledby="star_id">\n  <LegacyStack>\n    <Icon source={StarFilledMinor} alt="">\n    <Icon source={StarFilledMinor} alt="">\n    <Icon source={StarFilledMinor} alt="">\n    <Icon source={StarOutlineMinor} alt="">\n    <Icon source={StarOutlineMinor} alt="">\n  </LegacyStack>\n</div>\n<div id="star_id">3 of 5 stars</div>\n```\n\nFor more guidance, visit the W3C page on [complex images](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/complex/).\n\n### Situations that don’t need alt text\n\nWebsites can sometimes be noisy for a screen reader user. While alt text is vital for an equal experience, the briefer you are, the happier your screen reader users will be. Avoid repetition and unnecessary announcements by setting `alt=""` in the scenarios that don’t need it.\n\n#### Progress bars\n\nProgress bars often present visual information that can also be found in the text, such as "Loading 53%." Continuously announcing that change is generally considered annoying.\n\n#### Decorative elements\n\nThis is a broad category covering elements that are purely for aesthetic reasons, such as empty state illustrations, dividers, or hero images. If you’re unsure whether valuable information is lost, consider testing with people who regularly use a screen reader.\n\n#### Images with adequate captions\n\nAvoid adding repetitive alt text if an image has a caption that accurately reflects the information in the image, for example a photo of George Washington that is captioned "George Washington." If the image is presenting information that isn’t in the caption, consider adding it to the caption text. Only if this isn’t possible or appropriate should you add that information as alt text.\n\nIf the image has a longer description in the caption or following paragraph text, you can associate this description with the `aria-describedby` attribute.\n\n#### Tracking images\n\nImages that would not be visible to a sighted user should not be announced to screen-readers.\n\n---\n\n## Pronunciation and translation\n\nNot only do we strive to make interactions with our products pleasant, but we want the listening experience for merchants to be positive, too. Always state the language of the page content with the HTML lang attribute. This will ensure pronunciation and translation tools will know what rules to use. If certain phrases are in a different language than the main content, you can also use the lang attribute in a `<p>` tag or similar.\n\nHere’s a\n[standard list of language attributes](https://www.iana.org/assignments/language-subtag-registry/language-subtag-registry) that you can use in your document.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n```html\n<html lang="en"></html>\n<html lang="de"></html>\n<html lang="pt-BR"></html>\n```\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n```html\n<html></html>\n```\n\n</div></div>\n\n---\n\n## SEO\n\nBesides screen readers, search engines also read alt text. Alt text helps increase image ranking results and site searchability outside of Shopify’s admin.\n\nWhen accounting for SEO in your alt text:\n\n- Use logical keywords (the words that people search for).\n- Include relevant listing details, like if it is a limited edition or unique colorway.\n- Describe the image, not what you want your audience to think.\n- Don’t repeat your site name or brand name. Search engines will already associate your site with your images.\n- Avoid reducing the relevance or clarity of the alt text just to insert a keyword.\n- Never include unassociated lists of key words in the alt text. Instead, place those in your [meta description](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/promoting-marketing/seo/adding-keywords#edit-the-title-and-meta-description-for-a-page).\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n```jsx\n<Thumbnail alt="1460 Boot Limited Edition Oxblood Women\'s" />\n```\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n```jsx\n<Thumbnail alt="shoes sneakers womens footwear girls sizes soles heels boots" />\n\n<Thumbnail alt="Cool shoes for a night out or hot date" />\n```\n\n</div></div>\n\n## Resources\n\nFor detailed guidance on coding and alt text standards, visit the\n[Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag.php) or [WebAIM Alternative Text Guidelines](https://webaim.org/techniques/alttext/).

          'Error messages should:\n\n- Tell merchants what happened. If there’s a solution, explain it. If possible, offer a one-click fix with a button. If there’s\n  [no solution](#errors-without-solutions), give troubleshooting instructions.\n- Be placed close to the source of the problem.\n- Communicate severity using the appropriate [color](#colors) and\n  [tone of voice](#voice-and-tone).\n- Use\n  [plain language](/content/product-content#respond-to-merchant-needs).\n- Be specific. For example, use precise\n  [numbers and dates](/content/grammar-and-mechanics#dates--numbers--and-measurements).\n- Be brief.\n\nGood design can reduce the need for error messages by preventing them in the first place.\n\n---\n\n## Error message types\n\nThink about the scope of the error when selecting a message type. Is something wrong with the entire application, with the entire current screen, or with a specific element on the screen?\n\nIf the cause of the error is visible and the error just happened, show the error message immediately and as close to the source of the problem as possible.\n\n### [Text field validation error](#form-validation)\n\nUse when:\n\n- An error applies to a text field and feedback can be provided while merchants are typing\n\n![Text field validation](/images/text-field-validation-error@2x.png)\n\n### [Settings warning](#settings-warning)\n\nUse when:\n\n- The form input is valid, but you want to warn merchants of a consequence they might not expect\n\n![Settings warning error](/images/settings-warning@2x.png)\n\n### [Page-level banner: critical or warning](#page-level-banners)\n\nUse when:\n\n- An error applies to the entire page\n- The error is far down the page and it’s critical merchants see the message\n- Multiple validation errors on the page need to be summarized\n- The error was delayed and it’s okay to inform merchants of the problem when they return to the page\n\n![Yellow page level banner](/images/page-level-warning-banner@2x.png)\n\n![Red page level banner](/images/page-level-critical-banner@2x.png)\n\n### [Banner in a card or modal: critical or warning](#banners-in-cards-modals)\n\nUse when:\n\n- An error applies to a single card within the page, a single section within a card, or a modal\n- You need to direct merchants to a page with multiple sections and you want to visually call out the section with the error\n\n![Yellow section level banner](/images/section-level-warning@2x.png)\n![Yellow field level banner](/images/field-level-warning-02@2x.png)\n\n### [Exception list: critical or warning](#exception-list-errors)\n\nUse when:\n\n- A message placed within or next to a component can help merchants make better decisions about routine tasks\n\n![Warning exception list error](/images/exception-list-warning@2x.png)\n\n![Critical exception list error](/images/high-risk-fraud@2x.png)\n\n### [Home notification: critical or warning](#home-notifications)\n\nNote: Home notifications should rarely be used for errors. Always attempt to display an error close to the source of the problem.\n\nUse when:\n\n- A high-priority task must be completed immediately to continue using Shopify or avoid losing money\n- A feature doesn’t have a dedicated details page\n\n![Yellow home notification](/images/home-notification-warning@2x.png)\n\n![Red home notification](/images/home-notification-critical@2x.png)\n\n### [Admin unavailable](#admin-unavailable-errors)\n\nUse when:\n\n- A server error is preventing an entire page from being displayed, like with 400 or 500-series server errors\n- Account permissions are preventing someone from accessing Shopify\n\n![Admin page not found error](/images/page-not-found@2x.png)\n\n![Admin page load error](/images/admin-error@2x.png)\n\n---\n\n## Error colors\n\nRed is the scariest error color. Only use red for critical messages that merchants need to deal with immediately to avoid harm to their business. For example, if merchants don’t act on the message right away, they might lose money or their store might be suspended.\n\nYellow error messages still demand attention, but are more appropriate for messages that are part of a daily workflow.\n\n### Red (critical)\n\nUse critical messages to:\n\n- Bring attention to urgent tasks. If not dealt with immediately, merchants\' businesses will be noticeably impacted, like an account being suspended or money being lost.\n\nExamples of critical message types:\n\n- Update a payment method expiry date\n- Unsuspend an account\n- Review an order for fraud\n- Fix a problem that’s preventing payment from being processed\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n![Red banner with high fraud risk message](/images/red-banner@2x.png)\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n![Yellow banner with high fraud risk message](/images/yellow-banner@2x.png)\n\n</div></div>\n\nThe one exception to using red is in form validation errors because this is a standard convention merchants are used to seeing outside of Shopify.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n![Form validation with red banner](/images/validation-banner-red@2x.png)\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n![Form validation with yellow banner](/images/validation-banner-yellow@2x.png)\n\n</div></div>\n\n### Yellow (warning)\n\nUse warning messages to:\n\n- Help merchants fix issues so they can complete a common workflow or continue to the next step\n- Notify merchants about upcoming expirations or pending requests that, if not dealt with soon, could lead to problems in the future\n\nExamples of warning message types:\n\n- Fix a problem before proceeding to the next step.\n- Fix a problem at some point in a common workflow.\n- There’s a pending request.\n- There’s an upcoming expiration.\n- Changing a setting might have unintended consequences. See\n  [settings warning](#settings-warning).\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n![Yellow banner with warning message](/images/yellow-do@2x.png)\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n![Red banner with warning message](/images/yellow-dont@2x.png)\n\n</div></div>\n\n---\n\n## Anti-patterns\n\n### Avoid using toast for error messages\n\nAlthough error toast is still available, we discourage its use. Toast messages are too short to adequately explain what went wrong and how to fix the problem. Because the toast component appears at the bottom of the screen and disappears after 3 seconds, it can easily be missed. Reserve toast for errors not caused by merchants, like a connection issue. Always try to use a banner to inform merchants about persistent errors.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n![Toast error message](/images/dont-toast-error@2x.png)\n\n### Don’t use modals for errors\n\nModal dialogs are a good way to ask merchants to confirm a destructive action, but not to tell them an error has occurred.\nModals block merchants until a decision is made, which is likely to make merchants feel pressured. Most errors don’t need to block access to the rest of the feature.\n\n<!-- dodont -->\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n![Modal error message](/images/dont-modals-for-errors@2x.png)\n\n### Avoid using [home notifications](#home-notifications) for errors\n\nHome notification errors are for high-priority tasks that merchants must complete immediately to continue using Shopify or prevent\na negative impact to their business, like losing money.\nOne exception is errors for features that don‘t have a dedicated details page.\n\n</div></div>\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n![Home notification error message](/images/dont-home-notification@2x.png)\n\n</div></div>\n\n---\n\n## Form validation\n\n### Text field validation\n\nUse when:\n\n- A text field has formatting requirements. Use this pattern to enhance\n  [validation on form submission](#validate-on-submit).\n\nDon’t use when:\n\n- It takes\n  [more than a full second](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/rail#ux) to validate input and display a message. If there’s a lag before a validation message appears, merchants might shift their attention and miss the error.\n  Either find a way to improve the validation speed, or rely on the\n  [validation after form submission](#validate-on-submit).\n- The field is empty. Merchants might tab through a form before filling it out, and errors on empty fields can cause confusion and frustration.\n\n### Component\n\n- [Text field](/components/selection-and-input/text-field)\n\n### Content\n\n- Use two or three words to explain what’s wrong or what’s needed to fix the problem.\n- Avoid using the word "invalid" to define an error. When appropriate, use "not valid" instead.\n- Since the message is directly below the text field, the copy only needs to explain why the error happened. Optionally, the message can clarify what to do next or offer a one-click fix.\n\n![Text field validation error](/images/text-field-validation-error-no-cursor@2x.png)\n\n**Usage**\n\nDo an initial validation check as soon as merchants finish typing in the field.\n\nMerchants can be considered to be finished typing only when keyboard focus moves away from the field and there is at least one character in the field. This helps avoid marking the field as not valid before merchants are really done typing.\n\n![Initial validation check with purple border](/images/text-field-validation-purple-incorrect-input@2x.png)\n\nIf the validation check fails, show an error message below the field.\n\n![Text field turns red](/images/text-field-validation-error-no-cursor@2x.png)\n\nOnce a field has an error, complete validation checks after each keystroke.\n\n![Text field validation with cursor by incorrect semi colon](/images/text-field-validation-cursor@2x.png)\n\nRemove the error message as soon as the input becomes valid so merchants can immediately tell they fixed the issue.\n\n![Text field validation with purple border](/images/text-field-validation-purple-border-cursor@2x.png)\n\nIf the validation process is less than a second but not instant, show a spinner on the field to indicate validation progress.\n\n![Text field validation in loading state with spinner](/images/text-field-validation-loading@2x.png)\n\n---\n\n## Validate on submit\n\nValidate on submit is triggered when merchants press the form’s submit button. The submit button is often \\[Save\\], but can be another call to action.\n\nUse when:\n\n- Not all fields can be validated while merchants are typing. When a form is used for saving data, always validate on submit and validate text fields while typing. For example, if merchants never interact with a required text field, there’s no change to mark it as not valid until they press the submit button. The same applies to form controls other than text fields, such as radio buttons, and selects.\n\nDon’t use when:\n\n- A form doesn’t have specific validation requirements, or the form doesn’t save data. For example, a search form that returns no results should display an empty state, rather than a validation error.\n\n### Component\n\n- [Banner](/components/feedback-indicators/banner#navigation)\n\nAnd one or more of the following:\n\n- [Text field]\n- [Select]\n- [Choice list]\n- [Checkbox]\n- [Radio button]\n\n### Content\n\nBanner heading\n\n- Use a colon to introduce the list.\n- Make the heading instructional. Don’t just call out that there are {x} number of errors.\n\nBanner body text\n\n- Use the [list component](/components/lists/list#navigation) to itemize the errors\n- Start each list item with the label of the field that isn\'t valid, and describe the action needed to fix it\n\nIndividual field error messages:\n\n- See content guidelines for [validation while typing](#validate-while-typing)\n\n![Red form validation banner](/images/validation-banner-red@2x.png)\n\nRather than pointing out that there are {x} number of errors, be more descriptive. Explain that in order to save or continue, {x} number of fields need to be changed. For the bullet point instructions, see if you can word them to be more actionable, for example, “Add a discount code,“ instead of “Discount can’t be blank.“\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n![Instructional validation banner](/images/validation-banner-content-do@2x.png)\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n![Validation banner that only points out that there is an error](/images/validation-banner-content-dont@2x.png)\n\n</div></div>\n\n**Usage**\n\nAlways indicate submission progress. If the fields aren\'t valid, don’t clear or alter them on behalf of merchants during validation.\n\n![Spinner displaying on save](/images/submission-progress@2x.png)\n\nIf the form submission has a single error:\n\n- Move scroll position to the field that is not valid\n- Focus the field\n- Show an error message below the field\n\n![Validation error for a price entry field](/images/input-validation@2x.png)\n\nIf the form submission has multiple errors:\n\n- Move scroll position to the top of the screen\n- Use a banner to display a summary of all the errors\n- Show an error message below each field that is not valid so merchants can scroll through and make corrections\n\n![Red form validation banner](/images/validation-banner-red@2x.png)\n\n---\n\n## Settings warning\n\nUse:\n\n- To help merchants prevent potential mistakes\n- When form input is valid, but you want to warn merchants of a consequence they might not be expecting\n\nDon’t use:\n\n- For actual error states\n\nTip: Explore ways to prevent the warning message from showing at all. Look for opportunities to add help text or other contextual information to surface or highlight potential risks or consequences of taking, or not taking, the action.\n\n### Component\n\n- [Banner](/components/feedback-indicators/banner) without title\n\n### Content\n\n- Since the warning message is in close context to the action that triggered the warning, it should be short\n- Explain the risks or consequences of an action that’s just been taken\n- These messages don’t have to start with actionable language, like, “Change currency.” Here are some options\n  - Start with the word “This” and explain the consequence, for example, “This will affect inventory prices”\n  - Start by noting the action, then explain the consequence, “Changing {x} will affect {y}”\n- If available, link to a resource where merchants can learn more\n\n![In line warning banner below a drop down](/images/settings-warning@2x.png)\n\n---\n\n## Banners\n\n### Page-level banners\n\nUse when:\n\n- An error applies to the entire screen\n- The error is far down the page and it’s critical that they see the message\n- [A form was submitted with fields that are not valid](#form-validation)\n- If the error was delayed, for example, an action was taken and the error doesn’t immediately appear in context\n\nDon’t use when:\n\n- It’s possible to place the banner [in context] because the source of the error is in view and the event that triggered the action just happened\n\nFor multiple error guidelines, see [validate on submit](#validate-on-submit)\n\nPage-level banner errors should explain:\n\n- Where the error happened\n- What happened\n- Why it happened\n- What to do next\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n![Error message with arrows pointing at different parts of the message](/images/banner-breakdown@2x.png)\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- Unable to process payment for checkout with negative taxes.\n\n</div></div>\n\n### Component\n\n- [Banner](/components/feedback-indicators/banner)\n\n### Content\n\nHeadings should:\n\n- Clearly state the problem\n- Not use punctuation\n\nBody content should:\n\n- Explain how to solve the problem.\n- Use actionable language like “do x.” Don‘t use permissive language, like “you can x.” Be concise: no longer than 2 sentences.\n- Use periods.\n\nCalls to action should:\n\n- Be action-led (verb+noun format)\n- Aim for a one-click fix. If the error can be fixed via a single button or menu, offer that action directly in the error message.\n- Open a dedicated error-correction view for more complex problems such as reviewing a risky order or editing an unverified customer address.\n- Provide a link to documentation for information that may be valuable but can’t fit in a brief error message.\n\n![Page level warning banner](/images/page-level-warning-banner@2x.png)\n\n### Banners in cards and modals\n\nUse when:\n\n- Merchants are engaged in a task flow and you want to warn them about potential issues with the task at hand, or inform them something has gone wrong\n- Directing merchants to a page with multiple sections and you want to visibly call out the section with the error\n\nDon’t use when:\n\n- An error applies to the entire screen.\n- The error is far down the page and it’s critical that merchants see the message.\n- If the error was delayed. For example, an action was taken and the error doesn’t immediately appear in context. In these cases, use the\n  [page-level banner](#page-level-banners)\n\n### Component\n\n- [Banner](/components/feedback-indicators/banner#navigation)\n\n### Variant\n\n- Without title\n\n### Content\n\n- The more contextual the message, the less you need to say, so go straight to explaining what happened and how to fix\n- Keep to one sentence\n- Contextual banners don’t have titles\n- Try to add a next step, whether in a button or link\n- Use when there is more than one call to action\n\n## ![Warning banner at the top of a card below the card title](/images/section-level-warning@2x.png)\n\n## Exception lists\n\nUse when:\n\n- Items in a list are in a noteworthy state that you want to make merchants aware of, like a status, or piece of information (like a high risk order) that’s directly relevant to the information it’s connected to\n\nExample:\n\n- High risk order\n\nDon’t use when:\n\n- The source of the problem is an entire card or page\n\n### Component\n\n- [Exception list](/components/feedback-indicators/exception-list)\n\nVariant\n\n- Status: critical or warning\n\n### Content\n\nContent should:\n\n- Highlight an exceptional state that encourages clicking on the list item\n- Pair content with a warning or error icon\n- Always lead with what went wrong\n- A description is required\n- A title is optional\n- Links are optional but not common because the list item is actionable\n- Be concise\n\n![Exception list warning](/images/exception-list-warning@2x.png)\n\n![Exception list error](/images/high-risk-fraud@2x.png)\n\n---\n\n## Home notifications\n\nHome notifications are primarily used to prevent merchants from losing money or help them continue using Shopify if they don’t act on the error message instructions immediately.\n\nUse for:\n\n- High-priority tasks that must be completed immediately to continue using\n  Shopify or avoid losing money.\n- Important enough tasks that we wouldn’t want merchants to navigate to another place in Shopify to find it, or stumble upon while completing another task.\n- Errors for features that don’t have a dedicated details page. For example, before\n  Shopify Capital had a details page, related status messages were temporarily surfaced in Home.\n\nDon’t use for:\n\n- Tips or advice\n- Positive feedback\n- Confirmation messages\n- New feature announcements\n- Status messages, other than those for Shopify Capital\n- Messages that can be displayed in context\n- Error messages that should be displayed in context\n- Task-related errors like a problem with saving a page\n\n![Structure of home notification with a header, body content, and button](/images/home-notification-anatomy@2x.png)\n\n### Warning home notifications\n\nWarning home notifications are pre-emptive. They let merchants know that their finances will be impacted if action isn’t taken in a couple days or more, or that an action can be taken to make money sooner.\n\n- Financing request is pending\n- Warn about upcoming expiration\n- Pending status, like with Shopify Capital application status\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n![Warning home notification with credit card expiry message](/images/home-notification-warning@2x.png)\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n![Warning home notification with chargeback message](/images/dont-home-notification@2x.png)\n\n</div></div>\n\n### Critical home notifications\n\nCritical home notifications inform merchants of issues that:\n\n- Currently impact their finances\n- Will have an impact on their finances if action isn’t taken immediately\n- Prevent the normal operation of their business or account\n\nCritical home notifications can be used for these message types:\n\n- Trial expired\n- Domain expired\n- Credit card expired\n- Account is suspended\n- Shopify Payment payouts on hold\n- Payment processing issues\n- Payment authorizations expiring that day\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n![Critical home notification with account on hold message](/images/home-notification-critical@2x.png)\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n![Critical home notification with out of stock message](/images/dont-home-notification-02@2x.png)\n\n</div></div>\n\n---\n\n## Admin unavailable errors\n\nSometimes the admin can’t be displayed due to a network issue, browser limitation, connection problem, or server issue. 400 and 500 series errors fall in this category. In these cases, always explain what went wrong and provide merchants with a troubleshooting step, like refreshing the page.\n\nUse when:\n\n- A page or the entire admin can’t be displayed\n\nDon’t use when:\n\n- The error can be placed in context, close to the source of the problem\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n![Page not found error with internet connection message](/images/page-not-found-02@2x.png)\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n![Page not found error with oops, something went wrong message](/images/dont-page-not-found@2x.png)\n\n</div></div>\n\nDon’t use internal language in error messages and avoid using question formats.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n![Problem loading page error with troubleshooting tips](/images/admin-error@2x.png)\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n![Problem loading page error with content that talks about operational engineers](/images/dont-admin-error@2x.png)\n\n</div></div>\n\n### Component:\n\n- [Empty state](/components/layout-and-structure/empty-state)\n\n### Content\n\nHeadings should:\n\n- Heading should explain what went wrong\n- Body should help merchants troubleshoot the problem\n- Call to action should provide the most probable fix, like reloading the page, or going to the previous page or Shopify Home\n\n![Page not found error](/images/page-not-found@2x.png)\n\n---\n\n## Errors without solutions\n\nWhen a service issue occurs in Shopify or is caused by a third party, we don’t always have a solution to offer to merchants. In these cases, always explain what went wrong so they can attempt to troubleshoot. If available, provide them with a troubleshooting step, like refreshing the page or returning at a later time.\n\nUse when:\n\n- Merchants are being denied access to a page or the entire admin\n  [See admin unavailable errors](#admin-unavailable-errors)\n- A third party issue is causing a disruption to merchants’ workflows\n\nDon’t use when:\n\n- There’s literally any solution we can offer to merchants\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n![Carrier may not be able to pick up package error message](/images/warning-no-solution@2x.png)\n![Carrier may not be able to pick up package error message](/images/warning-no-solution-2@2x.png)\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- Don’t use the “Something went wrong.

Avoid sounding overly apologetic, too technical, or hyperbolic. Keep Shopify out of the conversation unless Shopify was the cause of the error. Don’t downplay the error by telling merchants not to worry or by adding humor to a negative situation.\n\nAvoid the word “please” so it’s not overused throughout the admin. Don’t downplay serious problems.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- Some of today’s sales data isn’t updated yet. This will be fixed soon.

          '## Basics\n\n### Active voice\n\nYou should (almost) always write in the active voice:\n\n- Subject (person/thing acting) verb (the action) object (receives the action)\n\nUse the active voice if merchants need to do something. It should be clear that the subject is the one doing the action.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\nAdd details to the product\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\nDetails were added to the product\n\n</div></div>\n\n### Passive voice\n\nTo tell if you’re using the passive voice, look out for:\n\n- When the object comes before the subject (“the item was purchased by the customer”)\n- Past tense verbs (“was added,” “was created,” and so on)\n- Forms of the verb “to be” (“was,” “is,” “were,” and so on)\n\nYou should almost always write in the active voice, but here’s when to use the passive voice:\n\n- To avoid referring to yourself or Shopify\n- To make it clear that you didn’t personally take an action or make a decision\n- If the object (thing being done) is more important than the subject (person doing the thing)\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\nInvoices are created monthly and emailed to\n[marki.yeung@nomail.com](mailto:Marki.Yeung@nomail.com)\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\nShopify creates and emails your invoices monthly to\n[simran.robichaud@nomail.com](mailto:Simran.Robichaud@nomail.com)\n\n</div></div>\n\n### Contractions\n\nContractions are abbreviated words. We use them to set a light and casual tone in the interface. The goal is to sound human, so avoid contracting verbs that sound awkward when you say them out loud, or have been phased out of modern day speech.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- You can’t have products with negative weights\n- Your products don’t have weights\n- You’re all set up\n- This product doesn’t require shipping\n- The customer name shouldn’t contain numbers\n- It’s a good time to plan your Black Friday sale\n- An error occurred and your changes couldn’t be saved\n- I’m Kit, your digital marketing assistant\n- This transfer hasn’t been received\n- You haven’t connected your account\n- You’ve exceeded 10 password attempts\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- That’ll make sure you are all set up\n- It would’ve been possible if you’d installed the latest updates\n- The set up was not complete, but this’ll do\n- There’re 10 products in this collection\n- Your product mustn’t be more than 20kgs\n- This product needn’t be shipped\n- There are 3 visitors who’ve viewed this product\n- You gotta set up Shopify Payments to use Shopify Capital\n- It’d be a good idea to place an ad this weekend\n\n</div></div>\n\n### Plain language\n\nUse words and language that our merchants use. Avoid jargon or technical terminology. Make sure each sentence has a single focus and keep them short. Aim for a Grade 7 reading level.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- We’ve made some changes to improve your store’s security\n- These products aren’t getting a lot of views, but visitors are adding them to their carts\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- Your SSL certificates were activated\n- These are your less popular products with the highest add-to-cart conversion\n\n</div></div>\n\n---\n\n## Capitalization\n\n### Headings\n\nUse sentence case for all headings:\n\n- Capitalize the first word of a heading\n- Capitalize proper or trademarked nouns (names of products, countries, or people)\n- Lowercase for everything else\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\nCreate purchase order\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\nCreate Purchase Order\n\n</div></div>\n\n### Product and feature names\n\nIn general, if a feature or product isn’t unique to Shopify, don’t capitalize it (such as blogs, navigation, pages). If it’s unique to Shopify and marketable as its own product, capitalize it (such as Shopify Payments, or Frenzy).\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- blogs\n- navigation\n- Shopify Payments\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- Blogs\n- Navigation\n- shopify payments\n\n</div></div>\n\n### Trademarks\n\nRespect the usage guidelines of any third-party intellectual property. For example, in US communications, Apple Pay requires you to include the trademark symbol (™) the first time Apple Pay appears in body copy.\n\nReview the third party’s brand usage guidelines to make sure you are using the company’s name and logo correctly.\n\n### Job titles\n\nJob titles should be capitalized when they come before or after a person’s name. When referring to a job title without referencing a name, don’t capitalize the job title.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- Content Strategist Jane Smith\n- Jane Smith, Content Strategist\n- Jane Smith is a content strategist.\n- The content strategist designed the information architecture.\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- content strategist Jane Smith\n- Jane Smith, content strategist\n- Jane Smith is a Content Strategist\n- The Content Strategist redesigned the information architecture.\n\n</div></div>\n\n### Letters following slashes\n\nThe first letter following a slash shouldn’t be capitalized.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\nZIP/postal code required\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\nZIP/Postal code required\n\n</div></div>\n\n---\n\n## Headings and subheadings\n\nSee the content guidelines for [headings and subheadings](/content/actionable-language#headings-and-subheadings) in the actionable language section.\n\n---\n\n## Lists\n\n### Bulleted\n\nUse a bulleted list when items are related but sequence or priority doesn’t matter.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\nUse Shopify Payments to:\n\n- Avoid the hassle of setting up a third-party payment gateway\n- Track your payout schedule from the Shopify admin\n- Minimize lost sales from chargebacks\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\nUse Shopify payments to\n\n- avoid the hassle of setting up a gateway,\n- track pending payout schedule,\n- minimize lost sales from chargebacks. And eliminate PCI fees\n\n</div></div>\n\n### Numbered\n\nUse a numbered list when item sequence or priority does matter, such as step-by-step instructions.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\nTo set up Shopify Payments:\n\n1.

Go to Settings from Shopify admin Then select Shopify Payments\n2.  Select Setup\n\n</div></div>\n\n### Dropdown menus\n\n#### Actions in a menu\n\nMenu lists give users a horizontal set of actions when space is limited. The order of actions is often based on logic such as most popular actions.\n\nActions in a menu follow a {verb}+{noun} pattern. If there’s enough context, only a verb might be required.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- Rename\n- Edit\n- HTML\n- Duplicate\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- HTML\n- editing options\n- File name changes\n- Duplicate this order so that you can make edits, updates, or changes\n\n</div></div>\n\n#### Nouns in a menu\n\nMenu lists give users a horizontal set of nouns when space is limited. The order of nouns is often based on logic such as most recent orders.\n\nNouns in a menu should be concise but still give the user enough information so they can easily find and accurately select the item they want.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\nSelect filter\n\n- Today\n- Yesterday\n- This week\n- This month\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- Filter visibility\n- Filter product type\n- Filter product vendor\n- Filter tagged with\n\n</div></div>\n\n### Capitalization\n\n- List items always start with a capital letter.\n- Capitalization and punctuation rules apply to both bulleted and numbered lists.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\nCompany name\n\n- Hidden\n- Optional\n- Required\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\nCompany name\n\n- hidden\n- optional\n- required\n\n</div></div>\n\n### Punctuation\n\n- Introduce bulleted lists with a colon or a heading.\n- Don’t use commas at the end of list items (for bulleted or numbered lists).\n- If any list item contains two or more sentences, punctuate all list items.\n- If all list items are one sentence or fragments, don’t punctuate.\n- Never put a comma or semicolon at the end of a bulleted or numbered list item.\n  Treat each list item as a self-contained piece of information.\n\n---\n\n## Dates, numbers, and measurements\n\nDates, numbers, and measurements are often formatted automatically according users’ local preferences, and they may be formatted differently in other languages. You can use [helpers](https://github.com/Shopify/quilt) to ensure they are localized automatically. These guidelines are for manually formatting in American English, which we use as a base before translating to other languages.\n\n### Date\n\nWhen possible, use the month’s full name. If there are space constraints, use 3-letter abbreviations. Don’t write dates with numerals only.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- Thursday, October 15, 2015\n- October 15, 2015\n- Oct 15, 2015\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- Thur, October 15\n- October 15, ’15\n- 10/15/15\n\n</div></div>\n\nDon’t use ordinal indicators, which are words representing position or rank in a sequential order (1st, 2nd, 3rd, and so on).\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\nJanuary 23–April 1\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\nJanuary 23rd–April 1st\n\n</div></div>\n\n### Time\n\nFor all translations, the time format is automatically localized by the `Intl.DateTimeFormat` JavaScript object. When time must be formatted manually, follow these guidelines:\n\n- Use the 12-hour clock, followed by am or pm.\n- Include a space after the last number. For example, “Your package will arrive at 12:35 pm.” Adding the space helps with formatting for English-speaking markets outside of North America, so we use it for North American usage as well.\n- Use the browser time of the logged in user.\n- To show a time range, use an en dash and include the am/pm after both times, for example, 3:00 pm–4:00 pm.\n- If indicating both the date and time, separate them with the word “at” instead of a comma.\n\n#### Time zones\n\n- Include a time zone only if it’s necessary, such as for an event listing.\n- Use the time zone’s abbreviation following the am or pm, for example, 4:00 pm NZT.\n- If your audience is in a single time zone, then don’t include an S (for Standard) or D (for Daylight). For example, 3:00 pm PT.\n- If your audience is in a combination of time zones, then include the S (for Standard) or D (for Daylight) to avoid confusion. For example, 3:00 pm PDT.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\nThursday, October 15, 2015 at 2:00 pm EDT\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n2015-10-15, CDT 2:00P.M.\n\n</div></div>\n\nUse consistent timestamp formats by following these examples:\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- Less than 1 min: `Just now`\n- 1 min to 60 min: `13 minutes ago`\n- Today: `10:30 am`\n- Yesterday: `Yesterday at 10:30 am`\n- In the last 7 days: `Friday at 10:30 am`\n- 7 days to 1 year: `Aug 14 at 10:30 am`\n- More than 1 year: `Aug 14, 2016`\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- Less than 1 min: `10:30am`\n- 1 min to 60 min: `10:30am`\n- Today: `Today, 10:30am`\n- Yesterday: `Friday, 10:30am`\n- In the last 7 days: `Friday, 10:30am`\n- 7 days to 1 year: `10:30am, Oct 15, 2015`\n- More than 1 year: `Last year`\n\n</div></div>\n\n### Currency\n\nWhen including currency with a price, the currency comes after the dollar amount. Learn more about [formatting localized currency](/foundations/formatting-localized-currency).\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- \\$10,000 USD\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- USD\\$10,000\n- \\$10KUSD\n- \\$10,000USD\n\n</div></div>\n\n### Numbers\n\nIn general, use numerals. If the number is below 10 and not integral to the sentence, spell it out in full.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- 9\n- 100\n- 1\n- Here are 2 marketing campaigns you can use.\n- You have 3 orders to fulfill.\n- You no longer need to track shipments in two places.\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- nine\n- one hundred\n- one\n- Here are two marketing campaigns you can use.\n- You have three orders to fulfill.\n\n</div></div>\n\nUse commas for numbers with four or more digits. Whenever possible, don’t truncate numbers:\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- 12,000\n- 9,344\n- 1,800,887\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- 12 k\n- 9344\n- 1.8 m\n\n</div></div>\n\nUse hyphens when writing phone numbers. Don’t use brackets, spaces, periods, or plus signs:\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- 613-555-1234\n- 1-514-555-1234\n- 33-55-416-123\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- 613.555.1234\n- 1-(514)-555-1234\n- +33 55 416 123\n\n</div></div>\n\nUse an en dash without a space on either side for number ranges:\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- 5–10 products\n- October 15–31\n- 2005–2015\n- 25–100 lb\n- \\$0.00–\\$49.99\n- 2:00 pm–3:00 pm\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- 5 – 10 products\n- October 15 – 31\n- 2005 – 2015\n- 25 – 100 lb\n- \\$0.00 – \\$49.99\n- 2:00 pm – 3:00 pm\n\n</div></div>\n\nUse “to” instead of an en dash if a number range is preceded by “from” in a phrase. Use “and” if a range is preceded by “between.”\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- You have a delivery scheduled from 10:00 am to 2:00 pm on Monday, July

(optional)\nCity\nCountry            Province           Postal code\n```\n\nPlease note, “optional” in `Apartment, suite, etc. (optional)` means that the field is optional for customers to complete, but we should always include it in the form.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- Use locale-specific alternatives for province and postal code, for example, the US uses State and ZIP code\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- Add extra fields\n- Change the placeholder text\n\n</div></div>\n\n### Country, province, and state names\n\nUse a nation’s proper name when referring to it as a noun.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\nYour store must be located in the United States.\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\nYour store must be located in the US.\n\n</div></div>\n\nWhen using a country as an adjective (such as when referring to currency), use the abbreviated form without punctuation.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\nPinterest requires your store to use US currency.\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\nU.S. currency\n\n</div></div>\n\nThings to watch out for:\n\n- Don’t use colloquial forms of a nation or state name, for example, America instead of the United States\n- Search online to see whether nations commonly use “the” before their name, for example, the Philippines or the Falkland Islands\n\n---\n\n## Punctuation\n\n### Ampersands\n\nDon’t use ampersands (&). They attract attention to the least important part of the sentence. Spell out the word “and.”\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\nZones and rates\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\nZones & rates\n\n</div></div>\n\n### Apostrophes\n\nUse apostrophes to represent omitted letters or numbers:\n\n- Omitted numbers (’40s)\n- Omitted letters (don’t, can’t, won’t)\n- Verb contractions (it’s, you’re, we’re)\n\nUse apostrophes to form possessives:\n\n- Singular nouns: add _’s_, even if they end in _s_ (merchant’s, bus’s)\n- Plural nouns that don’t end in s: add _’s_ (women’s, men’s)\n- Plural nouns that end in s: add an apostrophe (boxes’, customers’)\n\nDon’t use apostrophes to form possessive pronouns such as hers or his.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- Merchant’s store\n- Women’s clothing\n- Customers’ credit cards\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- Merchants store\n- Womens clothing\n- Customers credit cards\n\n</div></div>\n\nAlways use apostrophes, not vertical (straight) quotes.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- <span style="font-size: 5rem; line-height: 0; vertical-align: bottom">’</span> <kbd>option</kbd> + <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>]</kbd>\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- <span style="font-size: 5rem; line-height: 0; vertical-align: bottom">\'</span>\n\n</div></div>\n\n### Colons\n\nAvoid using colons in sentences. If you need to use one, don’t capitalize the first word after the colon unless it’s a proper noun.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\nYour store accepts payments with GoCoin and Shopify Payments.\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\nYour store accepts payments with: GoCoin and Shopify Payments. Merchants store, womens clothing, customers credit cards\n\n</div></div>\n\nDon’t use colons to introduce radio buttons or checkboxes.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\nIf the customer abandons their checkout, send them an email reminder to complete their order\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\nIf the customer abandons their checkout, send them an email reminder to complete their order:\n\n</div></div>\n\nIntroduce bulleted lists with a colon.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\nCorrect the following payment information to continue:\n\n- The credit card verification value (CVV) doesn’t match the credit card\n- The billing address street doesn’t match the street for the credit card\n- The billing address ZIP or postal code doesn’t match the credit card address\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\nCorrect the following payment information to continue.\n\n- The credit card verification value (CVV) doesn’t match the credit card\n- The billing address street doesn’t match the street for the credit card\n- The billing address ZIP or postal code doesn’t match the credit card address\n\n</div></div>\n\n### Commas\n\nUse the oxford comma (also known as the serial comma) in sentences. There should be a comma after every list of 3 or more items (unless you’re using a bulleted or numbered list).\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\nKit is an app that handles your online advertising, email marketing, and social media.\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\nKit is an app that handles your online advertising, email marketing and social media.\n\n</div></div>\n\nDon’t use commas to separate bulleted or numbered list items.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- The credit card verification value (CVV) doesn’t match the credit card\n- The billing address street doesn’t match the street for the credit card\n- The billing address ZIP or postal code doesn’t match the credit card address\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- The credit card verification value (CVV) doesn’t match the credit card,\n- The billing address street doesn’t match the street for the credit card,\n- The billing address ZIP or postal code doesn’t match the credit card address.\n\n</div></div>\n\n### Ellipses\n\nThe ellipses (…) can be used in place of a missing piece of text (most commonly to show the deletion of words from a direct quotation). Avoid using ellipses in text.\n\nUse ellipses for:\n\n- Truncation in the center of a title bar\n\nDon’t use ellipses for:\n\n- Placeholder copy\n- Trailing off a sentence\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\nSearch files\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\nStart typing to search for files…\n\n</div></div>\n\nAlways use the ellipsis character, not three periods.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n<code style="font-size: 5rem; line-height: 0; background-color: transparent">…</code> <kbd>option</kbd> + <kbd>;</kbd>\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n<code style="font-size: 5rem; line-height: 0; background-color: transparent">...</code>\n\n</div></div>\n\n#### Truncation\n\nConsider constraints of the space in the interface when deciding to use truncation. Think about what part of the string merchants needs most. It’s usually the beginning or end, which means you might have to truncate the middle of the string.\n\n#### Ellipses button component\n\nA button with an ellipsis icon (not the same as text) is used to expand more actions. It’s typically used in cards, or for horizontal sets of actions when space is limited.\n\n### En-dashes and em-dashes\n\nUse an en dash with no spaces in between (–) for a fixed range of numbers\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n2006–2013\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n2006 – 2013\n\n</div></div>\n\nUse an em dash only if you can’t make your message clearer by splitting it into two sentences. Use an em dash without a space on either side (—).\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\nChoose your theme’s colors, typography, and pictures—all in one place.\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\nChoose your theme’s design—colors, typography, and pictures—all in one place.\n\n</div></div>\n\nDepending on the font or appearance, you may want to include a hair space on either side of the en or em dash. HTML entity code for hair space is `&hairsp;` or `&#8202;`.\n\nTip: On Mac the keyboard shortcuts are option - for en dash and shift option - for em dash.\n\n### Exclamation marks\n\nAvoid exclamation marks—only use them for really really exciting things. If you absolutely have to, limit yourself to one exclamation mark per page.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\nYou’ve launched your first online store!\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\nYou’ve updated your product title!\n\n</div></div>\n\n### Hyphens\n\nUse hyphens to:\n\n- Form compound modifiers: two words that combine to modify or describe the noun that follows\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- Start your free, no-risk, 14-day trial.\n- This is a high-risk order.\n- This order is high risk.\n- Add weight-based shipping rates.\n- Add rates based on the weight of an order.\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- Start your free, no risk, 14 day trial.\n- This is a high risk order.\n- This order is high-risk.\n- Add weight based shipping rates.\n\n</div></div>\n\n- Join prefixes and suffixes only if there are two vowels beside each other. Never use hyphens in the words ecommerce and email.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- Re-order\n- Resend\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- Reorder\n- Reenable\n- Re-send\n\n</div></div>\n\n### Periods\n\nPeriods often end up in places they shouldn’t, and are omitted at strange times. In general, don’t use periods in interface copy unless it’s a full sentence description.\n\nWhen to use periods:\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- Complete sentences\n- Body text, descriptions, and subtitles\n- Help text under text boxes (form fields)\n- Timeline events\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- Sentence fragments\n- Top-level headings and titles\n- Buttons\n- Notifications\n- Toast messages\n- Placeholder copy\n- Navigation menu items\n- Hover/tooltip text\n- Footer help box text\n- Radio button and checkbox text\n\n</div></div>\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- Description example: Add this product to a collection so it’s easy to find in your store.\n- Placeholder example: Search products\n- Timeline example: \\$50.41 USD was authorized.\n- Footer help box example: Learn more about [products](https://help.shopify.com/manual/products)\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- Button example: Add product.\n- Placeholder example: Search…\n- Heading example: I’m Kit, your virtual employee.\n- Notification example: 6 orders have payments that need to be captured.\n\n</div></div>\n\n#### Periods for bulleted, numbered, and lists of links\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- Use when a list item has two or more full sentences, then also add periods to the whole list\n- Use for the description or helper text below a bulleted or numbered list item\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- Don’t use periods when a list has only single sentences or fragments\n- Don’t use periods for lists of links\n\n</div></div>\n\n### Question marks\n\nAvoid question marks wherever possible. Reword into affirmative statements wherever you can, but there are exceptions:\n\nIt’s okay to use question marks if you don’t know the result of the question:\n\n- “Did you forget your password?”\n- “Do you need to add a shipping rate?”\n\nDon’t use question marks if:\n\n- It’s the only option available: “Reset password”\n- It’s an on/off option: “Show quantity box”\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- Forgot?\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- Reset password?\n\n</div></div>\n\n### Quotation marks\n\nUse quotation marks to:\n\n- Define words (“growth-hacking”)\n- Quote text\n\nWhen it’s helpful to the merchant, use quotation marks to indicate input that the merchant has provided, such as a product title or file name. Use this indication only when the input appears in running text.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- Are you sure you want to delete “cat shirt”?\n- “Nike Air Max 90.png” failed to upload\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- Are you sure you want to delete **cat shirt**?\n- Nike Air Max 90.png failed to upload\n\n</div></div>\n\nIn general, place commas and periods inside quotation marks. When working with literal strings like typed commands or merchant inputs, place punctuation outside the quotation marks.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- “I see this all the time,” said Mary.\n- Avoid general words like “all,” “every,” or “most.”\n- To remove this item, type “DELETE”.\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- “I don’t understand why”, said Mitch.\n- We call it a “store”, not a “shop”.\n- There was an error with the file “cat_shirt.png.”\n\n</div></div>\n\nAlways use smart (curly) quotes, not vertical (straight) quotes.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- <span style="font-size: 5rem; line-height: 0; vertical-align: bottom">‘</span>\n  <kbd>option</kbd> + <kbd>]</kbd>\n- <span style="font-size: 5rem; line-height: 0; vertical-align: bottom">’</span>\n  <kbd>option</kbd> + <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>]</kbd>\n- <span style="font-size: 5rem; line-height: 0; vertical-align: bottom">“</span>\n  <kbd>option</kbd> + <kbd>[</kbd>\n- <span style="font-size: 5rem; line-height: 0; vertical-align: bottom">”</span>\n  <kbd>option</kbd> + <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>[</kbd>\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- <span style="font-size: 5rem; line-height: 0; vertical-align: bottom">"</span> or <span style="font-size: 5rem; line-height: 0; vertical-align: bottom">\'</span>\n\n</div></div>\n\n### Semicolons\n\nAvoid semicolons if possible. If you really need them, use semicolons to:\n\n- Connect two closely related ideas, as long as they are both independent clauses (full sentences that could stand on their own).\n- Replace a comma or the word “and” between two closely related ideas.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\nMy friends made me banana pancakes on my birthday; I’ve never been happier.\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\nThe unicorn was hungry; the grass was brown.\n\n</div></div>\n\n---\n\n## Spelling and formatting\n\n### American spelling\n\nUse American spelling for all external-facing Shopify content. When in doubt, check the [Merriam-Webster dictionary](https://www.merriam-webster.com/) for the preferred spelling of specific terms.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- Color\n- Center\n- Canceled\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- Colour\n- Centre\n- Cancelled\n\n</div></div>\n\nTip: it’s easy to miss Canadian spelling. Switch your laptop language settings to American English and turn spell check on. It will highlight any Canadianisms you might have missed.\n\n### Bold\n\nWhen in doubt, don’t bold.\n\nUse bold sparingly and only where strong emphasis is required. Don’t use bold to create a heading or emphasize:\n\n- Proper nouns\n- Merchant input\n- Checkbox titles\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\nAfter your first sale, PayPal will email you at **merchant&#64;email.com** with instructions.\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\nAre you sure you want to delete **Sunset T-shirt**?\n\n</div></div>\n\n---\n\n## You, we, and other personal pronouns\n\n### Addressing merchants\n\nAlways refer to merchants as “you.” Don’t speak for merchants with phrases that use “I” or “my.”\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\nChange your email address in your Profile.\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\nChange your email address in My Profile.\n\n</div></div>\n\nIn some cases (such as getting merchant consent or granting permissions) you should refer to merchants as “I.”\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n<p><label><input type="checkbox"> I agree to the terms and conditions</label></p>\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n<p><label><input type="checkbox"> You agree the terms and conditions</label></p>\n </div></div>\n\n### Referring to Shopify\n\nAlways refer to Shopify as “we,” but avoid inserting Shopify into the content as much as possible (except when a human is taking action, such as reviewing a request).\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\nPinterest Buyable Pins will be available in the coming weeks.\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\nWe’re making Pinterest Buyable Pins available in the coming weeks.\n\n</div></div>',

          'The goal of help content is to teach merchants:\n\n- How to complete a task or make a good decision for their business\n- Important information related to the current workflow\n- How to optimize the way they use Shopify\n\n---\n\n## When to use less, when to use more\n\n​\nThe choice of whether or not to use help content depends on the kind of experience you’re designing.\n\n### Productivity areas\n\n​\nProductivity areas include tasks that merchants do regularly, like adding products and fulfilling orders. These pages are used often and become familiar quickly.\n\nWhen designing productivity experiences, prioritize experienced merchants. This is their space to get work done and we can keep out of their way by offering a clean, streamlined UI. This means minimal help content.\n​\n\n### Educational areas\n\n​\nEducational areas include tasks that merchants do infrequently, like adjusting tax or payments settings. Most of these settings aren’t changed very often, so merchants doing these tasks are often seeing them for the first time.\n\nWhen designing for educational experiences, prioritize merchants who are unfamiliar with the task or workflow. Offer context and guidance to help them make the right decisions for their business. This means making use of help content.\n\n---\n\n## Place help where it’s needed\n\n​\nHelp content belongs as close as possible to the part of the UI it references. If it’s teaching merchants about the purpose of a card, put it at the top of the card as a description. If it’s teaching merchants about a particular field, put it beneath the field as help text.\n\nThe following is an example of help content that was originally a card description, but felt easier to parse after moving closer to the upload actions it helps with.\n\n#### Before\n\n![Before: help text as a card description](/images/before.png)\n\n#### After\n\n![After: help text close to the upload action](/images/after.png)\n\n---\n\n## Avoid a marketing tone\n\n​\nUsing help content to promote new features can erode trust with merchants. Not every feature is the best choice for every merchant at every point in time, and we shouldn’t assume that they want or need it.\n\nThere are times when our motivations and our merchants’ are highly aligned, and encouraging a certain action through help content might be appropriate. An example of this is discounted annual billing. It’s good for Shopify because of the long-term merchant commitment and up-front payment. It’s good for merchants who are long-term committed to Shopify and can pay up front.\n\nThis example also illustrates that there’s still only a subset of merchants that are at the right place to adopt it. Keep this in mind when suggesting how a feature might help someone’s business.\n\n---\n\n## “Learn more” links\n\n​\n“Learn more” links take merchants to the Shopify Help Center for more detailed information than we can offer in the UI.\n\nMake sure “learn more” links go to a Help Center page or heading that’s specific to the topic.\n\nThe Help Center is a rich resource, but for a merchant it’s not always a convenient time to read documentation. Landing on a dense page of information without knowing where to start is frustrating and disorienting. If there isn’t a page or heading specific to the topic you’re providing help for, work with the documentation team to create the right content.\n\n### “Learn more” badges for settings\n\n​\n“Learn more” badges show an information icon that takes you to the Help Center. These are different from tooltips. On large screens, they expand on hover to reveal a “Learn more” link.\n\n![“Learn more” badge interaction pattern](/images/learn-more-badges.png)\n\nUse “learn more” badges:\n​\n\n- Only in settings experiences, and only in card headers\n- When the linked Help Center topic is relevant to the entire card\n\nBest practices:\n\n- Use regular “learn more” links for help topics specific to only a part of a card\n- Some cards benefit from a “learn more” badge in the heading in combination with “learn more” links or other help content in the card body',

          'These guidelines are based on our experience writing help documentation for the\n[Shopify Help Center](https://help.shopify.com/). They’re all intended to serve the same goal: to educate and empower Shopify merchants.\n\nTo include a link to help documentation in your app or channel, use the\n[Footer help](/components/navigation/footer-help) component.\n\n---\n\n## Plan for your audience\n\nThe way you write your help documentation should change depending on the type of audience and their expectations. Take some time to plan for your audience.\n\n### Audience types\n\nWrite help documentation for its intended audience. For any given document, we can expect a wide spectrum of Shopify users as an audience:\n\n#### Prospective users\n\n- Not signed up yet, possibly on a free trial\n\n#### Novice users\n\n- Signed up but might not have sold online before\n- Possibly not very computer-literate\n- New to Shopify concepts and workflows\n\n#### Experienced, confident users\n\n- Have been using Shopify for some time\n- Familiar with the basic concepts and workflows\n- Confident with computers\n- Able to try some customizations with guidance\n\n#### Highly technical users\n\n- Experienced and confident\n- Extensive computing experience\n- Happy to experiment and take risks\n- Experienced problem-solvers\n- Self serve through forums and help documentation\n\n### Audience expectations\n\nEach of these different users will likely have different expectations for the same document. Let’s take a look at how that might play out:\n\n#### Prospective users\n\n- A quick-start guide\n- Conceptual overviews\n\n#### Novice users\n\n- Lots of hand-holding\n- Clear step-by-step instructions\n- Conceptual overviews\n- Definitions of terms\n- Tutorials\n- Context-sensitive help\n\n#### Experienced, confident users\n\n- Clear step-by-step instructions\n- Conceptual overviews\n- Definitions of terms\n- More challenging tutorials\n- Context-sensitive help\n\n#### Highly technical users\n\n- Procedural instructions (can be to-the-point)\n- Code fragments\n- Pointers to information sources\n\nThis is just one way to imagine the variety of users that fit into our audience.\nHowever we imagine their skill level, our aim for documentation remains the same: to accommodate a wide range of users and their objectives. We can do this by presenting information in a way that’s inclusive of different skill levels, different learning styles, and different workflows.\n\n---\n\n## Use headings to organize your document\n\nReaders come to help documentation with different expectations and in different usage settings. For example:\n\n- One might be working through a long, multi-stage setup process to connect a third-party app into her admin\n- Another might be using her tablet to check out the details of Shopify POS and see if it could be used at her cafe\n- Another might be trying to make a quick edit to his storefront in the half hour he has left before going to pick up his kids from school\n\nIn all these different cases, the reader needs documentation that’s findable, usable, and relevant—in short, organized.\n\n### Effective headings\n\nEffective headings make it clear to readers which sections of a document are most relevant to their current tasks (findability). Headings also provide them with a good sense of progress while they move from one task to the next\n(usability).\n\n### Low-level headings\n\nAs a general rule, the lower a heading is in the doc’s hierarchy, the more flexible you can be with its tone. For example, low-level headings can be longer and more specific, or less formal.\n\n### Heading hierarchy\n\nMaintain the heading hierarchy throughout the doc, and don’t skip heading levels. For example, go directly from H1 to H2, then to H3, and so on. This helps the readers know where they are in the document, whether they’re going through a specific workflow or just scanning.\n\n### Tips\n\nFor page or topic-level headings, use short, gerund (ing-word) based statements.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- Creating products from your admin\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- Create products from your admin\n\n</div></div>\n\nFor task-based headings within the document, use verb stems / imperatives.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- Add a customer\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- Adding a customer\n\n</div></div>\n\nAvoid pronouns and articles in headings to keep them short.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- Connecting Facebook accounts\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- Connecting a Facebook account\n- Connecting your Facebook account\n\n</div></div>\n\nAvoid long strings of nouns in a heading.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- Posting products\n- Creating posts\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- Creating product posts\n- Creating product post pages\n\n</div></div>\n\nKeep the key descriptors close to the front of a heading so it’s easier to scan quickly. For example, avoid starting the heading with “How to” or “To.”\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- Add a product\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- How to add a product\n\n</div></div>\n\nTry to keep parallel grammatical structure between headings of the same level.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- Boost a post, Choose an audience, Fulfill an order\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- Boost a post, Choosing your audience, How to fulfill your orders\n\n</div></div>\n\nIn most cases, headings should be statements rather than questions. Save question-style headings for FAQs or low-level headings that address specific functions.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- Add a product\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- How do I add a product?\n\n</div></div>\n\nUse sentence case for all headings, but no periods at the end. Format and capitalize interface elements or buttons in the way they appear in the Shopify admin.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- Adding products to your store\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- Adding Products To Your Store.\n\n</div></div>\n\nUse parallel structure in lists, headings, and pretty much everywhere else to encourage comprehension and recall.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- Adding products to your store, Deleting products from your store, Editing products in your store\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- Add products to your store, How to delete products from your store, Edit a product in your store\n\n</div></div>\n\n---\n\n## Document tasks\n\n### Be task-oriented\n\nMost help documentation is task-oriented: it’s designed to guide readers through the steps they need to follow to complete a task. The best documentation will save readers time by helping them complete their tasks quickly. The way that you present information has a big impact on how useful it will be to your readers.\n\n### Use introductions\n\nIn most cases, a document shouldn’t start with a set of instructions. Instead, offer context with an introductory comment or define a key concept about the topic. Decide what information readers need before they scan the instructions.\nThis is also true for the document’s subsections.\n\n### Use numbered steps\n\nDivide up the instructions in a way that reflects how the reader might think of the task. Use numbered steps for each part of the task. This helps to hold your reader’s attention, and makes it easier for them to switch between a help document and Shopify to complete the task.\n\n### Start at the beginning of a workflow\n\nMake sure that the instructions for major tasks in a longer document can stand alone. If the instructions for a task pick up abruptly where an earlier task left off, then the readers who begin at that point might struggle to figure out the workflow. Start documenting each task at the beginning of the workflow required to complete it.\n\n### Use short lists\n\nIn general, use short lists (either numbered steps or bullets), which are easier to read than long lists. If you have a task or a list that needs more than ten items, then break it up into two or more lists, each with their own subheading.\n\n### Make tasks actionable\n\nTell the user what they can do with your product, not what it can do. This means structuring documentation around user actions rather than product features.\nReaders aren’t there to read a spec: they want to keep their businesses up and running.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- Use this feature to keep track of key updates and promotions.\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- This feature notifies you about key updates and promotions.\n\n</div></div>\n\nIn general, avoid grouping multiple actions together in a single numbered step.\nEach step should include only one or two user actions.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n1.  From your Shopify admin, click **Products**.\n2.  Click **Add a product**.\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n1.  From your Shopify admin, click **Products**, click **Add a product**, and\n    then enter your product information.\n\n</div></div>\n\nAvoid telling the user to “find” or “locate” something in a task.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- In the Pinterest section, click **Remove channel**.\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- Find the Pinterest section, then click **Remove channel**.\n\n</div></div>\n\nUse the action word “select” when you’re telling the reader to pick something from a set number of choices (like from a list or dropdown menu), and use\n“choose” when you’re telling the reader to make a choice that’s more open-ended\n(like “Choose what kind of store you want to open”).\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- From the **Products** drop-down menu, select the one you want to discount.\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- From the **Products** drop-down menu, choose the one you want to discount.\n\n</div></div>\n\nUse consistent phrasing when referring to the reader’s choice. Use the most direct “If you want to” instead of more formal options such as “If you would like to” or “If you wish to.”\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- If you want to add a product, click **Add product**.\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- If you’d like to add a product, click **Add product**.\n\n</div></div>\n\nAvoid using “desired” in place of the more direct “want.”\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- Select the item you want to add to the order.\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- Select the desired item to add to the order.\n\n</div></div>\n\n---\n\n## Structure conditional statements\n\nFor conditional cases, start the step with “if” so the reader doesn’t have to read the whole sentence only to find out that the condition does not apply to them. It often helps to add a “then” to help the reader identify the condition and the outcome.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- If you need Z, then click A, B, and C.\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- Click A, B, and C if you need Z.\n\n</div></div>\n\n---\n\n## Clarify results of actions\n\nShow results of actions in the same step as the task and be clear about where in the flow the reader is.\n\n### Put actions and results in the same step\n\nIf you need to mention the results of a user action, then do it in the same numbered step that describes that action (don’t use a separate numbered step).\nIn general, omit results statements unless the result is surprising or unexpected.\n\n### Mention earlier steps to reinforce order of tasks\n\nYou can refer to an earlier step to reinforce the order of the steps.\n\nFor progress within a series of steps, use the phrase “When you’ve” or “After you’ve.” Avoid using “Once you’ve.”\n\nFor progress between tasks, begin a section with “Now that you’ve” or “After you’ve” (referring back to the previous action or step).\n\n### Use “make sure” and “confirm” for important tasks\n\nWhen asking the reader to confirm something, use:\n\n- “Make sure” in cases where there’s still a related important task (instead of\n  “check that” or “verify that”).\n- “Confirm” in cases where the reader has already been told to do something, and you’re now reminding them.\n\n### Tips\n\nFor instructions, use the command form of the verb.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- Click **Refresh** to show your new orders.\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- Clicking **Refresh** will show your new orders.\n\n</div></div>\n\nLimit the future tense to cases that actually refer to the future.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- Choose an end date. After this date, the boosted post will revert to a regular post.\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- Click **Save**. The price will change when the discount is applied.\n\n</div></div>\n\n---\n\n## Use screenshots for clarity\n\nScreenshots help visual learners understand complex tasks and add context to the tasks you’re documenting. Use them wisely.\n\n### Use screenshots for complex tasks\n\nIn general, don’t use a screenshot to illustrate every step in a task. Instead, save screenshots for places where the interface is complicated.\n\n### Make screenshots with equal margins\n\nWhen highlighting an area of a screenshot, try to show an equal amount of space around the area that you want the reader to focus on.\n\n### Use consistent images in a workflow\n\nTell a story by being consistent with details in screenshots within a document.\nFor example, you could follow a single order and keep the details the same from one screenshot to the next.\n\n---\n\n## Teach through documentation\n\nDocumentation is an opportunity for education. Building context, making instructions clear, and encouraging learning are key.\n\n### Link to next steps\n\nOffer links to the next steps. Choose the next steps based on reader profiles and feedback.\n\n### Encourage learning\n\nEncourage the reader to learn more. Explain the benefits of the feature in the introduction of your document.\n\n### Make the first tasks easier\n\nWhere you can, give the readers “early wins.” Make the first step or two of the task short and easy.\n\n### Build context\n\nConnect the current task to readers’ wider knowledge: other parts of Shopify, the store-building process, and even the business-building process.\n\n### Try not to repeat information on the same page\n\nIn most cases, avoid repeating information on a page. You might need to repeat important points to make sure the reader notices them. For example, you might repeat a warning from the document’s introduction within a set of instructions.\n\n---\n\n## Use the right tone\n\nThink of the context that the reader is in and what they might be feeling and thinking while they’re reading your documentation. This perspective will help you pick what type of tone to apply.\n\n### Instructional tone\n\nMost people don’t want to spend time reading documentation. They want to learn what they need to know, and then move on. The language in documentation needs to be short, to the point, and task-oriented. That doesn’t mean your writing needs to be terse or dry.\n\n### Lighter tone\n\nIn general, you can begin a document using a lighter tone.\n\n### Informal tone\n\nWhen you introduce a task, an informal tone can help draw the reader in, offer context, and encourage the reader to keep going. You can also use a more informal tone when introducing sub-tasks, to give the reader a break from the instructions.\n\n### Direct tone\n\nFor actions and tasks, aim for a much more direct tone. Keep your tone approachable by using contractions (for example _can’t_, _it’s_) to link directions and results.\n\n### Tips\n\nUse contractions.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- After you’ve set up your product, click **Save**.\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- After you have set up your product, click **Save**.\n\n</div></div>\n\nAddress the reader or user as “you.”\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- You can add products from the Products page in your Shopify admin.\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- Products can be added from the Products page in your Shopify admin.\n\n</div></div>\n\nKeep tone in check by avoiding the following:\n\n- Sounding patronizing, chummy, cheery, childish, or otherwise inappropriate in an attempt to seem informal and relatable.\n- Colloquialisms, jokes, sarcasm, jargon, and slang. Avoid anything that’s too culturally specific.\n- Anything that causes the user to pause or hesitate, unless you explicitly want them to.\n\n---\n\n## Use the active voice\n\nUse the active voice as much as possible, which generally sounds less formal than the passive voice. This means writing what merchants do, instead of what is being done by merchants. But in cases where the passive voice sounds more natural than the active voice, use passive voice (like with verbs such as “publish” or “assign” and with nouns like “discount”).\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- After you’ve added a product, click **Save**.\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- After the product has been added, **Save** must be clicked.\n\n</div></div>\n\n---\n\n## Improve readability\n\nIt’s important that the sentences you put together flow. Changing things up and knowing when things should be combined or separated will improve prose. Reading sentences that flow helps reader comprehension.\n\n### Avoid choppy writing\n\nUse linking adverbs, conjunctions, and prepositions liberally to avoid choppy writing.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- Click the button to open the window.\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- Click the button. The window opens.\n\n</div></div>\n\n### Change up sentence structures\n\nVary your sentence structure, especially in longer paragraphs. Try not to use more than two phrases with a “To x, do y” structure in a row—this gets repetitive and can cause the reader to lose interest. To break it up, add a short declarative sentence, if possible.\n\n### Break up complicated chunks\n\nUse conjunctions (a word that joins words or groups of words) to break up complicated passages.',

Use this guide when you’re writing content that a customer will see on a Shopify store or receive from a merchant.\n\nYou’ll find merchant-to-customer content in places such as:\n\n- Online store checkout pages\n- Shipping update emails\n- Return labels and emails\n- Point of Sale (POS) screens, such as digital receipts and payment errors\n\n---\n\n## What it isn’t\n\nIf you write for multiple audiences, it’s important to note that merchant-to-customer content isn’t:\n\n- Shopify-to-buyer content, such as Shopify Pay or Arrive\n- Shopify-to-merchant content, such as the Shopify admin\n- Shopify-to-world content, such as shopify.com or blog posts\n\n---\n\n## Experience values for customers\n\nShopify has a set of [experience values](https://polaris.shopify.com/foundations/experience-values). The ones to focus on when creating merchant-to-customer content are:\n\n### Considerate\n\nWherever and however a customer uses a Shopify experience (even if they don’t know it’s Shopify), we want it to work for them. The best Shopify experiences work on every screen, on every platform, in every language, and in every country.\n\n### Efficient\n\nShopify experiences help customers achieve goals faster, more accurately, and with less effort. We break complex tasks down into simple steps, use friction to highlight important decisions, and always set expectations about what will happen next.\n\n### Trustworthy\n\nShopify experiences are genuine, always honest, and transparent. We show customers that merchants act in the customer’s best interest. We create communication that strengthens the trust customers have in merchants.\n\n---\n\n## Merchant voice and tone\n\nMerchant voice and tone is customer-focused.\n\nShopify merchants sell everything from physical products, such as eco-sneakers, to digital products, like music downloads. The language they use is very different from store to store. This means that when writing from a merchant perspective, we use a voice that’s appropriate on any store, and for any type of customer. Merchant-to-customer content shouldn’t sound out of place coming from any merchant.\n\n### Human, but not individual\n\nToo much personality is inappropriate for some stores. Customers aren’t going through the purchase experience to admire the witty content. Research shows that the majority of people want content that’s easy to understand and communicates concepts efficiently. Not robotic. Not full of personality. Just clear and straightforward to help them complete their task.\n\nKeep in mind that some content, such as emails, can be personalized by merchants. You’re providing a default for them to work from.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- Your payment details couldn’t be verified. Check your card details and try again.\n- All transactions are secure and encrypted.\n- Select the address that matches your card or payment method.\n- Thanks!\n\n  This example is when the customer finishes checkout in person (all other examples are from online checkout).\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- A fatal error occurred.\n\nWhoops! Houston, we have a problem!\n\n- Don’t worry, your details are safe with us!\n- Address must correspond with that held by your payment provider.\n- Thanks for stopping by! or See you again soon!\n\n</div></div>\n\n### Shopping, not ecommerce: use shopper terms\n\nAvoid technical or ecommerce terms. Customers are interested in their order and their delivery, not in inventory and fulfillment. They might want to sign up for news and exclusive offers, but not marketing emails.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- Enter your name exactly as it’s written on your card.\n- You’ll get shipping and delivery updates by email.\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- There was a server verification error with your payment provider.\n- We’ll inform you when we’ve fulfilled your order.\n\n</div></div>\n\n### Concise, but not short\n\nIt’s important that any purchase flow is efficient. Use short, easy-to-understand words and phrases. For example:\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- Use “to”\n- Use “go to”\n- There was a problem with our payments\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- Don’t use “in order to”\n- Don’t use “proceed to”\n- No payment gateway is currently configured\n\n</div></div>\n\nBut remember that clear beats short. Don’t use content that can be interpreted in different ways. For example, does “bi-weekly” mean twice a week or every two weeks? It’s clearer to say “Every 2 weeks.” Using more words is okay if it provides clarity.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- Every two weeks\n- Getting available shipping rates\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- Bi-weekly\n- Loading\n\n</div></div>\n\nNo matter who the audience is, all Shopify content follows the same [grammar and mechanics](https://polaris.shopify.com/content/grammar-and-mechanics) and [product content guidelines](https://polaris.shopify.com/content/product-content).\n\nRead our general [voice and tone guidelines](https://polaris.shopify.com/content/voice-and-tone) to compare how Shopify talks to merchants.\n\n---\n\n## Vocabulary considerations\n\n“Buyer” and “customer” are similar so it’s easy to confuse the use of these terms.\n\nA “buyer” interacts with multiple Shopify stores or has a direct relationship with Shopify, such as through Shopify Pay.\n\nIn contrast, a “customer” is a person or organization who interacts with a Shopify merchant or a merchant’s sales channel.\n\nIn the Shopify admin and Point-of-Sale (POS), a customer appears on the Customers page when they engage with a merchant in an identifiable way. This could be because they:\n\n- were added or imported by the merchant\n- started a purchase but abandoned it at checkout\n- made a purchase\n- create a customer account\n- subscribed to the merchant\'s mailing list\n\nWord usage to use/avoid:\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- Use the store name in place of “merchant”\n- Be direct and use “you”\n- Focus on the merchant-to-customer relationship\n- Use “text message” or “message” when writing for North American audiences\n- Use noun + verb phrases for success messages, for example, ”payment sent”\n- There was a problem with our payments\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- Merchant (in place of store name)\n- Customer or customer (in place of “you”)\n- Shopify (keep Shopify out of the conversation)\n- SMS\n- Oh happy day! (don’t be over-congratulatory)\n- Wrong, fail, failure, error (avoid sounding robotic or negative)\n\n</div></div>\n\n### Common terms\n\nUse the following terms to refer to common concepts and actions within the merchant-to-customer experience.\n\nNote: all of these terms should be lowercase, unless they\'re a proper noun or the first word in a sentence.\n\n#### cart\n\nThe page that displays an order summary. Customers see this page before they proceed to checkout.\n\n#### checkout\n\nThe customer experience for paying for items and completing an order.\n\n#### delivery\n\nHow an order reaches the customer. Delivery covers more than just shipping. For example, customers can choose whether the order is shipped to their delivery address or picked up in-store.\n\n#### discount code\n\nA dollar amount, percentage, or code that dictates how much a product will be reduced in price.\n\n#### duties\n\nAdditional costs that may be incurred on orders that are delivered internationally. Duties may be incorporated into the shipping cost.\n\n#### gift card\n\nA type of product with monetary value that merchants can either sell to customers or issue to them as a gift, reward, or incentive.\n\n#### item\n\nOne unit of a product on an order.\n\n#### login\n\nThe credentials that a customer uses to access their account.\n\n#### order\n\nThe term for a purchase. Don’t say package, or add unnecessary words like sales order.\n\n#### payment\n\nDescribes a specific way a customer can pay such as Visa, MasterCard, or Apple Pay.\n\n#### pay now\n\nThis text is displayed on Call To Action (CTA) buttons that trigger a payment. On free orders, this is replaced with “Complete order”.\n\n#### pickup\n\nA delivery option where customers physically collect an order.\n\n#### return\n\nA transaction where a customer sends a product back to the store for an exchange or refund. A refund is part of a return.\n\n#### refund\n\nThe funds that a customer receives from a merchant, for example, when returning an item.\n\n#### shipping\n\nHow a merchant sends an order to a customer. Also known as the shipping method.\n\n#### subtotal\n\nThe cost of the items on an order before additional charges, such as tax and shipping.\n\n#### total\n\nThe cost of the items on an order after additional charges such as tax and shipping.\n\n#### you\n\nA way of referring to the customer that\'s checking out. Use you, or use the name that the customer has provided.\n\n#### we\n\nA way of referring to the store name. Most of the time, refer to the store by name. However, you can use “we” when using the store name would sound overly wordy or insincere.',

          '## Thoughtful naming\n\nNames influence how merchants and other audiences perceive and understand\nShopify. A well-chosen name will:\n\n- Put clarity above creativity\n- Help establish a mental model for our audiences\n- Enhance people’s perception of our brand\n- Increase adoption of the product or feature\n- Differentiate Shopify from other products\n- Clarify where a product or feature fits into our brand system\n\nThe naming process involves collaboration. Include different disciplines and people with different subject matter expertise in the creation of a name.\n\n---\n\n## Does it need a branded name?\n\nMost features don’t need an official, branded name. For example, order entry is\na feature that’s referred to descriptively and so doesn’t need to be capitalized. When choosing what to call a feature, pick words that describe what the feature does or represents. If there’s room, add extra context for merchants by describing the feature instead of using only the feature name.\n\nAvoid capitalizing descriptive feature names.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- Order entry\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- Order Entry\n\n</div></div>\n\nIf there‘s room, describe the feature instead of defaulting to only using the name.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- Display carrier calculated shipping rates to your customers at checkout.\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- Display carrier calculated shipping rates.\n\n</div></div>\n\n### Using “Shopify”\n\nOnly Shopify can use the word “Shopify” in a name. The word “Shopify” can’t be used to name third-party products.\n\nIt’s important we use the word “Shopify” consistently, and sparingly. Don’t use\n“Shopify” in a name unless there’s a lack of surrounding context and we want its target audience to know it’s associated with Shopify.\n\nAdding “Shopify” doesn’t add clarity in the context of other Shopify products and features. For example, merchants often confuse Shopify Shipping with the other shipping features, like shipping settings, carrier calculated shipping rates, shipping labels, and shipping zones. Our support staff have to refer to the Shopify Plan by its cost because the general name doesn’t distinguish it from the other plans.\n\nUse “Shopify” in front of a name when a product:\n\n- Is or will become a separate product or platform and we need to associate it with Shopify\n- Should be differentiated from other, similar products in the industry\n- Doesn’t justify an [evocative name](/content/naming#descriptive-vs-evocative-names), but still needs to associated with Shopify\n\nDon’t use “Shopify” in a name for built in functionality features, like fraud analysis or importing products.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- Shopify Payments\n- Shopify App Store\n- Shopify Theme Store\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- Shopify Analytics\n- Shopify Discounts\n- Shopify Account\n\n</div></div>\n\nShopify makes apps that merchants can add to their Shopify admin. It’s okay to say “Built by Shopify” or “Made by Shopify” after the app name. Once you’ve picked the format that works for the design, use it consistently.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- _Shopify_ Product Reviews\n- _Shopify_ Order Printer\n- _Shopify_ Shopcodes\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- Product Reviews\n- Order Printer\n- Shopcodes\n\n</div></div>\n\nApps that aren’t built by Shopify should not use the word “Shopify” in their name or say “for Shopify” after the name.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- AdSpace\n- Email Marketing\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- AdSpace for Shopify\n- Email Marketing for Shopify\n\n</div></div>\n\n---\n\n## Descriptive vs evocative names\n\nThere are two types of approaches to naming, the descriptive approach, or the evocative approach. Descriptive names are concrete, while evocative can be more abstract. Descriptive names are merchant friendly, and the most common. Features should always have descriptive names. Standalone products that require independent branding can use evocative names. Third-party apps and channels should have their own branded names and should never use the word “Shopify” in the name.\n\nIf you’re a Shopify employee and are looking to trademark an evocative name, ask the legal department for help.\n\n### Descriptive names\n\nFeatures and products connected to Shopify’s main product offering should have names that reveal something about their purpose. Avoid jargon and make sure the name you pick won’t get confused with similar names or terms.\n\nReserve evocative naming conventions for standalone products like Kit, and Frenzy.\n\nDescriptive names should:\n\n- Describe the experiences they represent\n- Fit into the information architecture of the product\n- Use merchant-friendly terms, not industry standard terms\n- Make sense in marketing materials\n- Align with brand\n\nIf it’s a default feature (merchants don’t have to sign up or opt in to use it), don’t [capitalize](/content/naming#general-guidelines) it.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- Shopify Capital\n- fraud analysis\n- Use analytics to review your store’s transactions\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- Shopify capital\n- Fraud Analysis\n- Use Analytics to review your store’s transactions\n\n</div></div>\n\nAvoid jargon and give merchants a hint about the actions they’ll be able to take when they interact with the product or feature.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- Shopify Help Center\n- Shopify Theme Store\n- discounts\n- Logo maker\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- Shopify Help Documentation\n- Configuration app\n- Shipity-do-dah\n\n</div></div>\n\n### Evocative names\n\nStandalone products use evocative names to position us in the industry. These unique and bold naming conventions can help with branding or recall, but don’t always help people understand the experience. They’re better for standalone products, and not for experiences that are part of Shopify’s main product offering.\n\nSometimes Shopify acquires a product or service that already has a unique, branded name. Even though it may become more tied to Shopify, it can keep its name to maintain its brand identity. This also helps maintain the context audiences already have about the product, like in the case of Kit.\n\nCertain standalone names use the word “Shopify” because it differentiates the product from similar ones in the industry, like Shopify Pay in comparison to\nApple Pay, or Android Pay. For more details, see the\n[guidelines for using “Shopify” in a name](/content/naming#does-it-need-a-branded-name-).\n\nEvocative names should:\n\n- Have a strong, independent brand identity\n- Help with branding or recall\n- Reflect the concept it represents\n- Make sense when used in marketing materials\n\nIf you work at Shopify and want to trademark a name, talk to the legal department. It’s easier to trademark unique or made-up name. These names have stronger identities, but it’s not always clear what they do.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- Frenzy\n- Kit\n- Oberlo\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- Flash sales app\n- The Marketing Bot\n- Drop Shipping app\n\n</div></div>\n\nSome evocative names can be more descriptive, although they’re harder to trademark if they use common terminology. Not all evocative names need to be trademarked.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- Burst\n- Shop Class\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- Free Stock Photography\n- Learn about Shopify event\n\n</div></div>\n\nIf you’re creating a website or product for an existing brand, maintain its brand identity and keep “Shopify” out of the name.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- Kylie Jenner Pop-up Shop\n- Kylie _Powered by Shopify_\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- Shopify Pop-up, featuring Kylie Jenner\n\n</div></div>\n\n---\n\n## Shopify products and features\n\nAn off-brand and unclear name can confuse your audience. It can also feel disconnected from the rest of Shopify.\n\nA good product or feature name should:\n\n- Help merchants understand what the experience represents\n- Fit into the information architecture of the product or website in which it belongs\n- Make sense when compared to other products, features, websites, or events in the same market\n- Avoid any negative or weird connotations\n\nThere are two types of approaches to naming, the\n[descriptive approach, or the evocative approach](/content/naming#descriptive-vs-evocative-names).\n\n### Referring to Shopify and areas in the admin\n\nUse consistent and easy to understand descriptions when referring to locations in product, especially in [help documentation](/content/help-documentation#navigation). Descriptive feature names aren’t [capitalized](/content/naming#general-guidelines), but when providing steps in a workflow, it’s okay to capitalize the page name, for example, “Go to the Products page”. Note that the page name is capitalized, but “page” isn’t.\n\nWhen referring to Shopify’s main product offering, use “Shopify”. The only exception is when you need to differentiate it from another product, like the mobile app, or explain a task specific to the admin. In these cases, you can use “Shopify admin”.\n\nA good description can:\n\n- Help establish a mental model for merchants\n- Clarify where the area fits into the product system\n- Help support staff and merchants understand each other when communicating\n\nA good description should:\n\n- Avoid jargon\n- Be used consistently\n- Describe the area it represents\n- Prioritize terminology used by merchants over industry standards\n\nUse consistent descriptions when referring to areas in the Shopify admin.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- The customer list is found on the Customers page.\n- When a new customer places an order with your store, their name and information are automatically added to your customer list.\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- Manage customers in Customers.\n- Customer information is automatically added to Customers in the Shopify admin.\n\n</div></div>\n\nMerchants call our main product offering “Shopify”, so we use that same terminology. terminology\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- Use “Shopify” when talking about our main product offering\n- Use “Shopify admin” if you need to differentiate it from the mobile app\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- Don’t use “admin” or “Shopify admin” if “Shopify” will do\n\n</div></div>\n\nTop-level marketing content is created for audiences who have little context about Shopify. Since they may not know about specific Shopify products, we use\n“Shopify” here too.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- Run your business using Shopify\n- Print shipping labels directly through Shopify\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- Use our ecommerce platform\n- Print shipping labels directly through Shopify’s admin\n\n</div></div>\n\n### Using “app” and “channel”\n\nFor app names in areas with surrounding context, like in the app store or on the\nApps page in the Shopify admin, don’t add the word “app” to the end of the name.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- Oberlo\n- Script Editor\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- Oberlo app\n- Script Editor app\n\n</div></div>\n\nFor app names without surrounding context, like in search in the Shopify admin, or on a home card, add “app” so merchants know what it is.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- Bulk Account Order app\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- Bulk Account Order\n\n</div></div>\n\nWhen writing about channels, make it clear to merchants that they are interacting with\na channel through Shopify, and not through the other company.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- The Amazon channel now supports electronics listings\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- Amazon now supports electronics listings\n\n</div></div>\n\nIf “channel” is used somewhere in surrounding content, it’s okay to drop it for titles and button copy. titles\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- Add Amazon\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- Add Amazon channel\n\n</div></div>\n\nNot every channel is a sales channel. For example, BuzzFeed is a marketing outreach channel and Facebook is a sales and marketing channel. Clarify channel types when you have room, otherwise default to channel. If there’s surrounding context, you can drop channel altogether.\n\nIf there’s surrounding context, drop the word channel from the name.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- Google Shopping\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- Google Shopping channel\n\n</div></div>\n\nIf there’s room for a description, explain the channel type.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- Use BuzzFeed’s marketing outreach channel to get more customers.\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- Use the BuzzFeed channel to get more customers.\n\n</div></div>\n\n---\n\n## General guidelines\n\nIn general, capitalize evocative names and don’t capitalize feature names. Avoid acronyms, and think about how your audience will interpret a name.\n\n### Capitalization\n\nDon’t capitalize default features. Default features are built into Shopify and merchants don’t have to sign up, add, or opt in to use them. Analytics and discounts are examples of default features.\n\nCapitalizing names should only happen:\n\n- For independently branded,\n  [evocative names](/content/naming#descriptive-vs-evocative-names)\n- When we want to try and claim specific words (think Tweet or Pin)\n- For names listed in top level navigation, like Products\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- Shopify Hardware Store\n- Shopify Theme Store\n- Black Friday Cyber Monday (BFCM)\n- Retail Package\n- Buy Button\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- Shopify hardware store\n- Shopify theme store\n- Black friday cyber monday (bfcm)\n- Retail package\n- Buy button\n\n</div></div>\n\nNames shouldn’t be capitalized if they:\n\n- Are [descriptive](/content/naming#descriptive-vs-evocative-names)\n- Include common, familiar words\n- Are default features\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- analytics\n- fraud analysis\n- online store\n- themes\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- Shopify Analytics\n- Fraud Analysis\n- Online Store\n- Themes\n\n</div></div>\n\n### Acronyms and abbreviations\n\nAn acronym is a word formed from parts of an existing compound term. For example, “rich text editor” could be written as “RTE”. An abbreviation is a shortened form of a written word or phrase used in place of the whole word or phrase. “Amt” is an abbreviation for “amount”.\n\nOur stance on acronyms:\n\n- Avoid creating acronyms.\n- Acronyms take longer to understand and might reduce adoption of a product, feature, or concept.\n- Acronyms are like inside jokes—people who understand the acronym feel included in the meaning, but people who don’t feel left out and confused.\n- If you have to use an acronym, spell it out the first time you use it and follow with the acronym in brackets.\n- Internationally understood acronyms and abbreviations are acceptable, like the word “app” or “SEO”.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- Rich text editor\n- Multi label printing\n- Merchant Success Manager\n- Virtual reality\n- Build a Bigger Business\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- RTE\n- MLP\n- MSM\n- VR\n- BABB\n\n</div></div>\n\nAvoid using Internet slang acronyms in Shopify products and when creating new, branded names. These acronyms are exclusive to certain online communities and branded approachable for everyday merchants.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- Shop Class\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- Shopify IRL\n\n</div></div>\n\nInternationally understood acronyms and abbreviations are acceptable. Some of these include time zone, tax, barcode, weight, and size abbreviations.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- SEO\n- NZDT\n- SMS\n- QR codes\n- HST\n- CVV\n- SKU\n- ISBN\n- UPC\n- GTIN\n- USD\n- 1 kg\n- 2 lbs\n- App\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- Search engine optimization\n- New Zealand Daylight Time\n- Short messaging service\n- Quick response codes\n- Harmonized sales tax\n- Card verification value\n- Stock keeping unit\n- International standard book number\n- Universal product code\n- Global trade item number\n- United States Dollar\n- Kilogram\n- 2 pounds\n- Application\n\n</div></div>\n\nWhen using a country as an adjective (such as when referring to currency), you may use an abbreviated form without punctuation.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- Pinterest requires your store to use US currency.\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- Pinterest requires your store to use United States currency.\n\n</div></div>\n\n### Similar names\n\nBeing an ecommerce platform has its naming challenges. For example, a lot of feature names could include the word “shipping” or “pay”. Think merchant-first and be descriptive to differentiate the name. Picture what it’s like to have conversations with merchants about similar names like Shopify Payments and conversationsor around our pricing plans to identify names that might be confusing. confusingming a new product or feature:\n\n- Conduct an audit of existing names to narrow down your naming choices\n- Ask the support team to see if they think it’ll conflict with another name\n- Draft a test conversation around similar sounding names\n\n### Localization and translation\n\nNames may not translate directly to other languages. Identify if you need to create a separate name, or if a direct translation will do.\n\nBefore confirming a name, check with people who work in translation and localization to find out if:\n\n- There are cultural considerations\n- A different name for a different location would have a positive impact for brand\n\nSome already existing names are different depending where you’re from. For example, in North America, people say, “I’ll send you a text.” In India and Nordic countries, people say, “I’ll SMS you.” Do your research and find out what people call things in everyday conversations.\n\nUse “text message” when writing for North American audiences.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- text message\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- SMS\n\n</div></div>\n\nUse SMS when writing for Indian and Nordic audiences.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- SMS\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- text message\n\n</div></div>\n\n### Initials\n\nIn languages that use logographic characters, like Japanese, name initials can have different meanings. For example, in Japanese a name like Chikako (周子) Ishikawa (石川) means “neighborhood stone” (周石) in initials. Check with the localization and translation team before writing something in short form in another language.\n\n#### Avoiding negative connotations\n\nSome words or terms have unintended negative connotations for some audiences. Do some research to avoid associating offensive words or phrases with your product or feature name.\n\nStart by:\n\n- Getting people outside of your team to look at the name with a new perspective\n- Doing a Google search to see if it surfaces with another meaning\n\n---\n\n## Components\n\nBe strategic and consistent when naming [components](/components). It makes it easier to create and build products and features for Shopify when people can switch between implementations and see the same names represented throughout. For example, we should use the same name across Rails, React, and Figma. It’s okay if each implementation has its own spelling convention. For example, “Account connection” in documentation and in Figma layer names, but “ui_account_connection” in Rails, and “AccountConnection” in React.\n\nA good component name can:\n\n- Increase adoption of a component\n- Clarify where a component fits into our system\n- Help establish a mental model for people using the components\n\nComponent names in documentation should:\n\n- Describe the functionality they represent\n- Avoid jargon so different disciplines understand its function\n- Be written in singular, not plural, format\n\nIn documentation we write out the name without any punctuation and use sentence case, meaning, the first word is capitalized and the rest is lowercase.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- Type scale\n- Empty state\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- TypeScale\n- EmptyState\n\n</div></div>\n\nIn code, we use the same name as the documentation, but can alter the spelling convention to suit the implementation.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- TypeScale\n- EmptyState\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- Type scale\n- Empty state\n\n</div></div>\n\nFor subcomponents, the same rules apply. In documentation, write out the name with a space between words, and use sentence case. with\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- Layout section\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- Layout.Section\n\n</div></div>\n\nFor subcomponents in the code, use a period in place of the space.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- Layout.Section\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- Layout section\n\n</div></div>\n\nFor all components, use American spelling:\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- Layout.Center\n- Palette.Color\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- Layout.Centre\n- Palette.Colour\n\n</div></div>\n\nThere is an exception: the Labelled component uses the British spelling, following the `aria-labelledby` attribute as per the [ARIA specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#aria-labelledby) itself.\n\n---\n\n## Icons\n\nIcons should be named consistently so they’re easy to find and implement across\nShopify.\n\nOverall, icon names should:\n\n- Represent the intended function of the icon\n- Avoid jargon so different disciplines understand its function\n\nProduct area icons should:\n\n- Only be used to symbolize their specific product area or function\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- Home\n- Orders\n- Products\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- House\n- Invoice\n- Price tag\n\n</div></div>\n\nFunctional icons not tied to product areas should represent a clear action.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- Add image\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- Image\n\n</div></div>\n\nIcons with more than one function should be named to:\n\n- Represent their purpose\n- Describe how they look\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- Circle alert\n- Camera\n- Clock\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- Alert\n- Photography\n- Time\n\n</div></div>',

They’ll also give you clear, tactical suggestions designed to help you use language to craft better experiences.\n\n[Each component](/components) also includes content guidelines about how to write for specific interface elements.\n\n## Respond to merchant needs\n\nNot everyone is a confident writer, but everyone can improve their content by making sure it responds to the needs of their audience. Keep in mind that real people rely on Shopify every day to run their businesses. The product, feature, or app you’re building can make a big difference to the people using it. Take some time to learn about who they are, what they need, and the language they use.\n\n- Only use industry-standard terminology when you have reason to believe it will improve understanding. Spend time researching what words people use, rather than defaulting to what corporations call things.\n- Edit unnecessary or repeated words.\n- Write for small screens first. Constraints can help you focus on the most important message.\n- Read your content out loud. If you get tripped up or it doesn’t sound like something a human would say, your content needs to be edited.\n\n---\n\n## Encourage action\n\nPeople use Shopify to get things done, whether they’re managing a store, or making a purchase. Content should be written and structured to help the reader understand and take the most important actions.\n\n### Tips\n\n- Calls to action on buttons and links should start with a strong verb that describes the action a person will take when they click.\n- Always prioritize the most important information and task — don’t make people dig to find what they care about. toBreak down complicated tasks into steps that help people focus on one thing at a time.\n- Use the [active voice](/content/grammar-and-mechanics#basics) to clarify the subject and the action.\n\n---\n\n## Be consistent\n\nTo help your audience understand key concepts and actions they can take, use consistent nouns (words used to identify people, places, or things) and verbs\n(action words) wherever possible.\n\n### Tips\n\n- Get in the habit of making a list of all the most important verbs and nouns in the experience you’re building.\n- Look at your word list. Does each word clearly describe the object or action it represents in the simplest way possible?\n- Does your language reflect how people think and the words they use?\n- Identify synonyms (a word or phrase that means exactly or nearly the same as another word or phrase in the same language), and eliminate them. Each important object and action should have a single word to represent it.',

          '## What are voice and tone?\n\nShopify’s voice is a reflection of who we are. We should always sound like\nShopify.\n\nAt the same time, some aspects of our personality might be more or less apparent, depending on the audience and their context. That’s tone.\n\n---\n\n## Shopify’s voice\n\nOur voice is a reflection of who we are. So who are we?\n\n**Simply put, we’re a company, built by real people who understand this business and care about helping others succeed.**\n\n**That should be clear every time someone uses our products or services.**\n\nMost often, we show this through well-crafted tools that help people get their jobs done efficiently. But there are times when our personalities and perspectives should be more apparent. In those times, we should adapt our tone to respond to people in an appropriate and meaningful way.\n\nYou\'ll find more specific guidelines on how to adapt your tone to different situations in this guide.\n\n---\n\n## Voice guidelines\n\nAs Shopify’s voice, we should always:\n\n### Be real, but not too tough or overly familiar\n\n- Use business casual language—be plain-spoken, not pretentious or overly playful\n- Be upfront and honest with merchants, even if we make a mistake\n- Communicate with clarity and empathy—be direct, not insensitive\n\n### Be proactive, but not needy or pushy\n\n- Offer merchants sincere encouragement and practical advice\n- Clearly explain how merchants are impacted when something goes wrong, but don’t overexplain with redundant content\n\n### Be dynamic, but not scattered or impulsive\n\n- Communicate in a way that respects merchant emotion and context\n- Avoid words that generalize success like “every,” “all,” and “most”\n- Use language that supports action, movement, and progress\n\n### Guide, but don’t handhold or prescribe\n\n- Use expertise to help merchants succeed; don’t talk down to them\n- Be specific when explaining benefits without making things sound better than they are\n- Teach people the “why” and “how” behind actions—don’t just tell them to do something\n\n---\n\n## Adapting tone by situation\n\nOur tone adapts to the context. We’ll use certain voice attributes more or less based on the situation.\n\nOften people frame tone guidance around adapting to the emotional state of the audience. The reality is we never know a person’s emotional state. Even when things seem the most positive, we can’t be sure.\n\nWhile it’s helpful to consider how your audience is likely to feel, don’t assume or tell them how to feel. Instead, focus on the specifics of the situation and less on the emotions. Here are some of the most common situations to consider.\n\n### Everyday tasks and activities\n\nWhen everything is working as it should, our goal is to give people what they need to get work done, without getting in the way or drawing attention to ourselves. We want the audience to know what something is or that something has happened as expected.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\nLook for the simplest way to communicate information—words aren’t always necessary.\n\n![Images showing icons of an eye representing a “view” action, a picture frame representing the concept of "images" and a spyglass representing the action of "search".](/images/view-icon@2x.png)\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\nUse overly complicated or intimidating language.\n\n![Image showing a toggle switch on a card labeled “Use Biometrics for Authentication”](/images/biometrics-toggle-card@2x.png)\n\n</div></div>\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\nBe consistent for identical actions or destinations when possible.\n\n- _Delete product_\n- _Delete collection_\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\nAdd extra text just to fill space.\n\n![Image showing a text field for notes labeled “Add a note” followed by an ellipsis](/images/add-note-field@2x.png)\n\n</div></div>\n\n### Learning and education\n\nSometimes it helps to give more explanation or education. In these situations, we want to make sure people feel confident in their actions and in our capabilities.\n\nSome people will want to be guided step-by-step through the process, while others may just want to try it out and learn on their own. Look for ways to give them both options.\n\nRemember, they may have sought this out specifically or we may have recommended it to them, so don’t assume that they want or need to use it.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\nHelp people understand why they should do something, not just how.\n\n![A home card suggesting to add a shipping policy to your store to build trust with customers](/images/shipping-policy-card@2x.png)\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\nOversell or overpromise.\n\n_Create a new campaign and you could double your sales this holiday season._\n\n</div></div>\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\nBreak down complicated tasks into steps that help people focus on one thing at a time.\n\n![A home card with separate tabs for adding a product, customizing a theme, and adding a domain](/images/onboarding-tasks@2x.png)\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\nBe overly prescriptive about how someone should use a feature.\n\n_You need to add at least 10 products before opening your store._\n\n</div></div>\n\n### Simple errors\n\nWhile we do our best to be proactive and protect against unexpected events, they still happen. These are often simple mistakes or roadblocks to action that can easily be fixed. Although they aren’t necessarily errors or problems, they can feel that way at first.\n\nIn this case, our job is to help people understand what happened so that they can get back to work as quickly as possible\n\nRead the [error message guidelines](https://polaris.shopify.com/patterns/error-messages) for more detailed guidance.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\nClearly explain the situation and how it can be resolved.\n\n_Product weight needs to be positive.

Depending on the level of effort, these may be simple confirmations or more active recognition that they completed something difficult.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\nIf this is a task people do regularly, make it clear that the step is complete in a simple and non-intrusive way, like a [toast](/components/feedback-indicators/toast). Consider ways to confirm completion without words or messaging.\n\n_Product saved_\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\nAssume people are excited or celebrating. They may be annoyed if it was a particularly long process or if the immediate benefits aren’t clear.\n\n_Congrats! You set up your single login for Shopify._\n\n</div></div>\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\nIf the task was something we initiated or required, thank them for their time.\n\n_Thanks for taking the time to share your feedback._\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\nRefer to simple actions or completed steps as “successes.”\n\n_You successfully added a product._\n\n</div></div>\n\n### Motivate or encourage action\n\nThese are situations when we want to keep people moving along a desired path. In most cases, we do that with direct information and clear steps to encourage action.\n\nWe don’t want to be too overzealous or action-driven here—it’s more about helping people understand the next step and giving them the context they need to take it.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\nHelp people understand what the next steps are and why they should take them.\n\n_Your email address is connected to 8 accounts. Set up a single login to switch between stores faster and log in less often._\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\nAssume the next step or outcome is guaranteed.\n\n_You’re just a few steps away from receiving your first order._\n\n</div></div>\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\nProvide guidance to help people understand if the decision is right for them.\n\n_Based on your type of business, this is the POS hardware we recommend:._\n\n</div></div>\n\n### Serious problems or errors\n\nThere are times when we need to share bad news. This might be an outage or an error, or it may be a product that we’re no longer supporting. These are hopefully rare situations, but they will happen.\n\nIn this case, there’s a serious risk of damaging trust and hurting our relationship with the audience, so we should be very careful about how we communicate.\n\nRead the [error message guidelines](https://polaris.shopify.com/patterns/error-messages) for more detailed guidance.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\nExplain the impact on their business clearly, without using confusing or scary language.\n\n_Some of today’s sales data hasn’t been updated yet.

In the coming days we will be working to fully understand how this widespread internet infrastructure failure affected our platform._\n\n</div></div>\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\nProvide clear steps to resolve issues. If there’s no solution, be direct about what that means for the merchant and what we’re doing about it.\n\n_Your Shopify Payments account is on hold. Please attach your State Tax Exemption Certificate for review._\n\n</div></div>\n\n### Announcing new features and updates\n\nIt’s exciting to launch a new feature or update, but always consider the audience’s perspective first. While we may be excited about the benefits and capabilities, change can be intimidating or annoying for users.\n\nWhen you’re announcing something new, focus on educating and explaining what it is, what it’s used for, and what the user can expect.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\nPitch our product by explaining the specific merchant benefits.\n\n_**Introducing the new Buy Button**_\n\n_Make it your own with custom fonts, colors, and styles. It also loads 50% faster so your visitors won’t miss it._\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\nJust talk about ourselves and assume the experience for merchants will be easy.\n\n_**Get Shopify’s new Buy Button**_\n\n_It’s never been easier to customize the fonts, colors, and styles of Buy Buttons. It’s also twice as fast._\n\n</div></div>\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\nIf possible, let users dismiss announcements or postpone changes until they’re ready.\n\n![A modal with a secondary button option to “remind me later” for a “single login” feature.](/images/remind-later-button@2x.png)\n\n</div></div>\n\n### Celebrations and congratulations\n\nThere are occasionally times when we want to celebrate an event or milestone, or to congratulate someone for an important accomplishment. In reality, this should be one of the least common situations we encounter.\n\nLet audiences know that we understand that it’s an important moment and we’re excited for them, but be careful not to take credit for it.

Shopify employees can contribute to any Polaris project, including the Figma UI Kit. Open source contributions are welcome for [Polaris React components](/contributing/components) and their [documentation](/contributing/documentation).\n\n## When to contribute\n\nContributions can seem intimidating, but they don’t have to be!

          'Bug fixes can be as simple as removing a typo, or as complex as refactoring a component to address a performance or accessibility issue. Enhancements usually add to or update the props of an existing component to extend its functionality or presentation. New patterns can be contributed by simply adding a new example to an existing component’s documentation, or by adding new components or utilities. Often component contributions are a mix of these.\n\nStart planning your contribution as early as possible to account for the scope in your timeline. To get help with the strategy for your contribution early on, start a [discussion](https://github.com/Shopify/polaris/discussions/new) with the Polaris community. If you have a smaller question, reach out in #polaris if you work at Shopify, or the [Shopify Partners Slack](http://shopifypartners.slack.com) if you’re an open source contributor. Once you’ve decided on the best way to solve the problem, submit a [feature proposal](https://github.com/Shopify/polaris/issues/new?assignees=&labels=Feature+request&template=FEATURE_REQUEST.md) or [bug report](https://github.com/Shopify/polaris/issues/new?assignees=&labels=%F0%9F%90%9BBug&template=ISSUE.md) issue. Then contribute the change by shipping a pull request.\n\nOften the changes you make to a component’s code impact the [documentation](/contributing/documentation) and [Figma UI Kit](/contributing/figma-ui-kit). If you work at Shopify, component contributions should be a team effort across disciplines. If you’re an open source contributor, we’ll work with you to update the Figma UI Kit once you [create an issue](https://github.com/Shopify/polaris/issues/new/choose) or [open a pull request](/contributing/shipping-your-contribution#open-your-first-pr) in the `Shopify/polaris` repo.\n\n## Update props\n\n### Considerations\n\nThere are many ways to make a Polaris component more flexible. Updating or adding props is the most common way to add flexibility to the way a component looks or works. Sometimes refactoring the component is [a better path](#add-or-improve-a-component).\n\nComponents should be performant, accessible, and maintainable. When contributing a new prop or updating the types of an existing prop, ask yourself how your change might:\n\n- Be backwards compatible\n- Increase or maintain performance\n- Improve or maintain accessibility\n- Address a pain point in the merchant experience\n- Reduce complexity of the source code\n\nIf a component isn’t flexible enough to meet your project’s requirements, or you’re unsure whether a component is right for your use case, submit an [issue](https://github.com/Shopify/polaris/issues/new?assignees=&labels=Feature+request&template=FEATURE_REQUEST.md) or [open a pull request](/contributing/shipping-your-contribution#open-your-first-pr) outlining the problem and the approach you’re thinking about. We’re happy to collaborate to find a solution.\n\n### How to contribute\n\nTo add or update a prop:\n\n1. Explore and align on whether to add a new prop or update the types of an existing prop\n2. Submit or assign yourself to an existing [feature proposal](https://github.com/Shopify/polaris/issues/new?assignees=&labels=Feature+request&template=FEATURE_REQUEST.md)\n3. [Prepare your development environment](/contributing/shipping-your-contribution#setting-up-your-local-developement-environment)\n4. Add your change to the props interface\n5. Include or update the description comment\n6. Update the `@default` value if relevant in the props interface and in the props deconstruction at the start of the component’s definition\n7. Add tests to cover the changes\n8. Add examples to the component’s documentation\n9. Commit your changes and [open a pull request](/contributing/shipping-your-contribution#open-your-first-pr)\n\n---\n\n## Fix a bug\n\n### Considerations\n\nBug fixes are high impact contributions that ensure we deliver a reliable, crafted experience to merchants. Whether you’re a seasoned contributor or looking to make your first pull request, there’s a bug report open for every level of experience.\n\nIf you’re just getting started with contributing to Polaris React, look for issues that are:\n\n- Labeled as a [good first issue](https://github.com/Shopify/polaris/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22Good+first+issue%22)\n- Not yet assigned to someone\n- Haven’t been updated in two or more weeks\n\n### How to contribute\n\n1. Submit or assign yourself to a [bug report](https://github.com/Shopify/polaris/issues/new?assignees=&labels=%F0%9F%90%9BBug&template=ISSUE.md).\n2. [Prepare your development environment](/contributing/shipping-your-contribution#setting-up-your-local-developement-environment).\n3. Assess the time and difficulty of finding and fixing the problem code.\n4. If you discover that fixing the bug is too complex or will take longer than you’re able to commit, that’s okay! Your findings will help the next developer move the needle on shipping a fix.\n   <br /> - Update the issue with a comment detailing your findings. Describe the problem code and share permalinks to the lines involved.\n   <br /> - If you have a potential fix locally, commit and push your changes and open a draft pull request that links to the bug report.\n   <br /> - Add or update the issue’s labels to indicate level of difficulty.\n   <br /> - Unassign yourself from the issue.\n5. If after investigating you arrive at a solution to the issue:\n   <br /> - Update the issue so everyone knows a fix is on the way.\n   <br /> - Commit your changes and [open a pull request](/contributing/shipping-your-contribution#open-your-first-pr).\n\n---\n\n## Add or improve a component\n\n### Considerations\n\nFrom perceived performance and accessibility enhancements, to the evolution of our design language, contributing UX improvements to Polaris components empowers teams to make sweeping changes effectively with minimal technical debt upstream.\n\nWhen exploring the potential for improving the look, feel, and or experience of a component:\n\n- Prioritize accessibility\n- Check [W3C](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/) for examples of the pattern the component implements\n- Consider whether the existing component could be replaced entirely if it were broken up into smaller components\n\n### Case study\n\nIn the years since Polaris launched in 2017, we’ve learned a lot from the Shopify and design system communities. As the system’s matured, we’ve found that many of the components should evolve toward [composition over configuration](https://maecapozzi.com/blog/composition-vs-configuration/). Many props is a signal that a component is solving too many problems or is too opinionated. When that’s the case, there’s an opportunity to refactor the component or build a new component to better meet merchant needs.\n\nFor example, `Autocomplete` implements [the combobox with list pattern](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/combobox/). When the Deliver team looked into fixing bugs in the component, they decided it would benefit from being broken down into two new components. They contributed `Combobox` and `Listbox` and refactored `Autocomplete` to use them. This reduced complexity and made `Autocomplete` easier to maintain.\n\nThe Deliver team partnered with the Polaris team to improve the UX of tag autocomplete inputs in a follow-up project. To accomplish this, we refactored `Combobox` and `Listbox` to support [the combobox with both list and inline autocomplete pattern](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/example-index/combobox/combobox-autocomplete-both.html) with automatic selection. Every `Autocomplete` in the Shopify Admin benefited from those improvements without any code changes needed upstream in the app.\n\n### How to contribute\n\n1. Submit or assign yourself to an existing [feature proposal](https://github.com/Shopify/polaris/issues/new?assignees=&labels=Feature+request&template=FEATURE_REQUEST.md) or [new component proposal](https://github.com/Shopify/polaris/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=NEW_COMPONENT.md)\n2. [Prepare your development environment](/contributing/shipping-your-contribution#setting-up-your-local-developement-environment)\n3. Prototype and iterate on your proposal, testing with merchants as you iterate if possible\n4.

The idea behind Polaris not being a ceiling is that you shouldn’t limit your ideas to fit into existing system pieces too early. Zoom out, figure out the best design solution to the problem, and then see if Polaris has all the pieces for you to design that solution. If there’s a gap, then [contribute](https://polaris.shopify.com/contributing) to the system to make it better.\n\n## Zoom out\n\nNo matter what problem you’re solving, zooming out allows you to get a better understanding of the problem, and its sphere of influence. A problem rarely exists in isolation, so understanding context and contributing factors is key before getting into solutions. Practically speaking, this means that you should understand the product as a whole, not just the product area you’re working on.\n\nFor instance, if you work on Orders, you should have a holistic understanding of the Shopify admin so you can leverage existing patterns and mental models. You can also gain context and empathy for merchants through research.\n\nMerchants don’t care about Shopify’s internal organization. They use the admin as a whole, so we must design with the whole experience in mind.\n\n![Illustration of three tag autocomplete inputs implementing the same pattern, but using different components.](/images/02.png)\n\nThe Deliver team identified a need to consolidate 6 different tag components with varying UX that were doing the same job in different sections of the admin. The redundancy in components was causing a fractured user experience.\n\n## Explore freely\n\nWhen you understand the product as a whole, you should be well equipped to explore without constraints. That means don’t start from our UI kit, component library, or patterns you see in the product---start with a blank sheet of paper instead. Solve the problem, preferably in more than one way, before you start worrying about consistency.\n\n![Illustration of three different ways to improve the design and experience of the tag autocomplete input.](/images/03.png)\n\nAs the Deliver team was working on consolidating the 6 components, they also identified an opportunity to improve the overall usability for adding tags. The team explored several different ideas and approaches to understand which approach would best solve the problem.\n\n## Calibrate\n\nOnce you understand the problem and potential solutions, you can start aligning more closely with the design system.\n\n![Illustration of before and after improving the design of the tag autocomplete.](/images/04.png)\n\nThe team made updates to the Polaris foundational pieces like the tag, icon, and interactions so that they could use those pieces to build a more opinionated component.\n\nIf you have initial questions about contribution, reach out in #polaris if you work at Shopify, or the Shopify Partners Slack if you’re an open source contributor. To get help with the strategy for a larger contribution, start a GitHub discussion with the system community.',

The monorepo includes:\n\n<!-- prettier-ignore -->\n| `polaris` |     |\n| ---------- | --- |\n|`/polaris-for-vscode` |VS Code extension for Polaris Design Token autocompletion|\n|`/polaris-icons` |npm SVG icon library `@shopify/polaris-icons`|\n|`/polaris-react` |npm React component library `@shopify/polaris`|\n|`/polaris-tokens` |npm Design Token library `@shopify/polaris-tokens`|\n|`/polaris.shopify.com` |The style guide to the Polaris Design System|\n|`/stylelint-polaris` |Linting rules for using Polaris Design Tokens through CSS custom properties|\n\n### Technologies we use\n\nTo manage our monorepo, we use:\n\n- Yarn for package management\n- Turborepo and Yarn workspaces for monorepo workflows\n- Changesets for managing release notes and change logs\n\nEvery Polaris project is a little different, but in general we build with JavaScript, TypeScript, and Sass. This documentation site is built using React and Next.js.\n\n## Get set up\n\nTo contribute to Polaris components, icons, or documentation, you’ll need to use your preferred `git` interface to commit and push up your changes. Whether that’s the command line in your favorite terminal, or in GitHub Desktop is entirely up to you. For this guide, we’ll illustrate the steps with terminal commands.\n\n### 1. Download the repo\n\n#### Shopifolk\n\nClone the polaris repo\n\n```bash\ngit clone <https://github.com/Shopify/polaris.git>\n```\n\n#### Open Source Contributors\n\n[Fork](https://github.com/Shopify/polaris/fork) the polaris repo\n\n### 2. Install and build\n\n```bash\nyarn && yarn build\n```\n\n### 3. Create a new branch\n\n```bash\ngit checkout -b new-branch-name\n```\n\n## Open your first PR\n\n### 1. Test your changes\n\nAs you work, commit and test your changes:\n\nIf your changes affect Polaris React components, you’ll need to test the examples and documentation of affected components. For more thorough testing edit the sandbox files found in the `/polaris-react/playground` directory.\n\n```bash\nyarn turbo run dev --filter=@shopify/polaris\n\n# Open https://localhost:3000 to test documentation\n# Open https://localhost:6006 to test Storybook examples and Playground sandboxes\n```\n\nIf you are adding or editing documentation, ensure your content displays as expected on the style guide website:\n\n```bash\nyarn turbo run dev --filter=polaris.shopify.com\n```\n\n### 2. Commit your changes\n\nSave the changes you’ve made to your branch.\n\n```bash\ngit commit -m “descriptive message”\n```\n\nPush up your branch to GitHub\n\n```bash\ngit push origin new-branch-name\n```\n\n### 3. Create a pull request\n\nUse the "New pull request" button from the [your branch](https://github.com/Shopify/polaris/branches/yours) list to create a pull request for your changes.\n\nIn your PR’s description, be specific with what you’ve tested as well as what reviewers should focus on when testing your changes, for example:\n\n- Keyboard and screen reader accessibility\n- Interaction state changes\n- UI changes\n- Small screen vs large screen UX\n- Other considerations or feedback you’re seeking regarding how you’ve implemented your changes\n\nAdd a [changeset](https://github.com/Shopify/polaris/blob/main/.changeset/README.md#changesets) if your PR includes any changes that will require a package version bump and release. Otherwise, add the `🤖 Skip Changelog` label to your PR.',

          'To help you figure this out, start by plotting out where each solution fits in this “perfect vs consistent” framework. Rate the solutions according to:\n\n- Consistency with the rest of the product (x axis)\n- How appropriate the solution is for your specific situation (y axis)\n\n![Illustration of a graph with "Perfect for situation" on the y-axis and "Consistent" on the x-axis.](/images/01.png)\n\nTo practice this framework, let’s imagine some possible scenarios. Consider the more obvious directions:\n\n![Illustration of a graph with "Perfect for situation" on the y-axis and "Consistent" on the x-axis.](/images/02.png)\n\nWhen deciding between A or B, go with A. It’s the better solution to the problem, assuming all options are inconsistent.\nA or C? Obviously C. Of two equal solutions, choose the one that is more consistent with the rest of the experience.\nA or D? D is consistent, but A is a much better solution to the problem. In that situation, it is likely that you can [contribute the new pattern to the system](https://polaris.shopify.com/contributing/documentation), so others can leverage it in the future.\n\nNow let’s look at the less obvious directions:\n\n![Illustration of a graph with "Perfect for situation" on the y-axis and "Consistent" on the x-axis.](/images/03.png)\n\nGo with A if it’s the perfect solution and has the potential to scale to the rest of the system\n\nDeciding between A or E is trickier. If A is clearly better than E, but E is much more consistent, go with A. This is because A has potential to become a system pattern and eventually get closer to E, and maybe even surpass it, in terms of consistency.\n\n![Illustration of a graph with "Perfect for situation" on the y-axis and "Consistent" on the x-axis.](/images/04.png)\n\nGo with E when consistency trumps perfection\n\nGo with E if A seems like a snowflake solution. Building a snowflake solution will make it difficult for other teams to adopt it. Breaking consistency is also costly because new, custom solutions add complexity to the experience and are hard to learn, so its benefits should significantly outweigh the cost of inconsistency.\n\nWhen both are appropriate and there’s not a massive difference in value, consistency trumps perfection.\n\nThe key here is to zoom out. When we’re [designing for scale](https://polaris.shopify.com/contributing/designing-with-a-system), we need to think broader and look at our specific problem area as a small part of a larger system. So spend some time figuring out if your solution is unique, or if it has potential to solve other problems. This is why it’s important to have good awareness of the whole experience before you start, and why it’s important to contribute back to the system if you land on a solution that would benefit others.\n\nFor initial questions about contribution, reach out in [#polaris](https://shopify.slack.com/archives/C4Y8N30KD) if you work at Shopify, or the [Shopify Partners Slack](http://shopifypartners.slack.com) if you’re an open source contributor.

The Polaris team is here to help you with planning, but we can’t be pulled in last minute to unblock.\n\nThe best way to get help is through our support channels:\n\n- [GitHub discussions](https://github.com/Shopify/polaris/discussions/6750) to talk to the community about anything from patterns, to potential contributions\n- #polaris in Slack if you work at Shopify and have a general inquiry\n\nAs you’re building you may need custom styles. In those cases, always use Polaris [tokens](/tokens).\n\n## Product team tips\n\nWith some early planning and intentional systems thinking, the build stage will go a lot smoother.\n\n### Plan for systems changes ahead of time\n\nThe Polaris team should never be pulled in to unblock a team from shipping something quickly—we’re here to support and guide teams when they’re planning their strategic system changes ahead of time. Teams at Shopify should start working on their system needs early in the design and build process and are expected to make [quality system contributions](/contributing#what-makes-a-good-contribution) ahead of their ship dates.\n\n### Aim to systematize your custom solutions\n\nThings don’t always go according to plan. If a team is still learning how to plan for system changes and finds themselves under pressure to quickly ship something custom, they’re responsible for owning any custom components they ship. The components should use [Polaris tokens](https://polaris.shopify.com/tokens/colors) and the team should make an effort to systematize the custom solution down the road. When product-wide changes happen in the future, the product team will be responsible for updating their custom components.\n\n## Collaborations for system contributions\n\nWhen an opportunity for a collaboration related to a system contribution comes up, we’ll add it to our [backlog](https://github.com/orgs/Shopify/projects/2250/views/5) for triaging. Collaboration opportunities can be worked on through cross-product team pairings and don’t always have to be with Polaris.\n\n### Triaging considerations\n\nDuring our triaging process, teams can expect that the Polaris team will help:\n\n- figure out how a component can be composed and/or how a pattern can be systematized\n- see if and where the contribution should be added to the system\n- identify system dependencies for making the contribution\n- identify other teams that could join the collaboration (and determine if the Polaris team needs to be involved)\n\nThe Polaris team will prioritize collaborating on contributions that:\n\n- have the highest number of community upvotes in Github discussions\n- help other teams solve similar problems so that we make the best possible impact on the merchant experience, like through pattern documentation\n- align with ongoing system improvement projects, for example, a team wants to make layout improvements while the Polaris team improves the layout foundations\n- break down large and complex composite components into primitive, foundational components\n- improve foundational components\n\n### Polaris support during collaborations\n\nIf the Polaris team is the main collaborator on a system contribution, the Polaris team will:\n\n- pair with the contributor(s) asynchronously, or when it’s more efficient, through ad hoc video calls\n- direct internal contributors to the #admin-ux community if extra feedback is needed on the solution being explored\n- offer systems coaching to the subject matter experts with the most context on the merchant problem that’s being solved\n- help the contributor with any systems tooling related to shipping the solution\n\n## Polaris on-call support\n\nThe Polaris team rotation schedule assigns one UXer and one developer to cover system inquiries and collaboration requests. Coverage is during their distributed working hours, Monday to Friday. The pair on rotation will:\n\n- direct internal #polaris Slack questions to a resolution\n- direct large requests for collaboration to @polaris-enablement for triaging\n- review, clean up, or close GitHub issues\n- provide PR reviews where necessary\n- participate in GitHub discussions where necessary\n\nIf an issue doesn’t get resolved by the end of their work day, it’s passed along to the next scheduled support pair.\n\nIf a Polaris team member is messaged directly, they’ll forward the inquiry/request to the internal #polaris channel for the pair on call to respond.\n\nAdmin pattern questions should be posted in the #admin-ux channel and if a question relates to #polaris, it should be forwarded to the #polaris channel.\n\n### Response time goals\n\nThese response time goals are for GitHub and our internal #polaris Slack channel.\n\n| Request type                                                                                                                                 | Initial response time                                                                         | Time to resolve                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Production grade bug in shopify/web and shopify/polaris                                                                                      | @here in the internal #polaris channel and the support person on call will respond.           | As soon as possible                                                                                                                                                                             |\n| **System inquiry**<br/> A response would help move things along but the problem can continue to be solved without the response               | 24 hours                                                                                      | 48 hours                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n| **Collaboration request**<br/> An opportunity has been identified for an individual or team to collaborate with Polaris to evolve the system | 72 hours: [Github discussion](https://github.com/Shopify/polaris/discussions/6750) is started | 1 week: Discussions identified for a larger Polaris team collaboration have an issue added to the [Polaris backlog](https://github.com/orgs/Shopify/projects/2250/views/5) for project triaging |\n\n### Third party developer response times\n\nPolaris is an open source project used by Shopify employees, and Shopify Partners building apps.

Color supports the purpose of the content, communicating things like hierarchy of information, interactive states, and the difference between distinct elements.\n\n### Colors have meaning\n\nColors have assigned roles, which hold a specific meaning based on how they function within the interface. Defined color roles make things easy to modify and customize later. They also extend the color system so it works across any touchpoint at Shopify.\n\n### Colors follow accessibility guidelines\n\nThe color system is designed within the HSLuv color space to generate themes that meet WCAG 2.1 compliant contrast ratios. This makes things easier to find, identify, and interact with. It also makes the whole experience more accessible for merchants who are color blind or who have low vision. However you should never convey information using color alone.\n\n---\n\n## Color roles\n\n![Diagram of colors representing the new Polaris color system](/images/color-roles@2x.png)\n\nWe define colors based on the role they play in the interface. There are 10 color roles, which we use to generate the values of all the color variants in the palette.\n\n![Diagram presenting color variants in a user interface](/images/color-variants@2x.png)\n\n### Color variants\n\nColor variants are variables that apply color to the UI, and their values are generated from the color roles. Color variants are available as tokens.\n\n![Diagram presenting a color naming pattern for the color token Border Success Subdued](/images/color-variant-naming@2x.png)\n\nVariants share a naming pattern that references their color role, the interaction state they define, and any UI elements they’re linked to.\n\n---\n\n## The color system in action\n\nHow the color roles relate to the variants, and how they’re applied across the interface.\n\n### Surface\n\nSurface colors affect surfaces of components, such as page, card, sheet, and popover.\n\n![Diagram presenting the surface color role, with mainly white and gray colors](/images/color-role-surface@2x.png)\n\n### On surface\n\nApply on-surface colors to elements that appear on neutral surfaces, usually borders, secondary icons, and text elements.\n\n![Diagram presenting the on surface color role, with mainly black and darker gray colors](/images/color-role-onsurface@2x.png)\n\n### Primary\n\nUse primary colors for primary actions like buttons, icons and text on navigation and tabs, and for the background in navigation and tab interactive states.\n\n![Diagram presenting the primary color role, with mainly green colors](/images/color-role-primary@2x.png)\n\n### Secondary\n\nUse secondary colors for secondary and tertiary buttons and the background of form elements.\n\n![Diagram presenting the secondary color role, with mainly white and gray colors](/images/color-role-secondary@2x.png)\n\n### Interactive\n\nUse interactive colors for things like links, focus indicators, and selected interactive states.\n\n![Diagram presenting the interactive color role, with mainly blue colors](/images/color-role-interactive@2x.png)\n\n### Success\n\nSuccess colors indicate something positive, like the success of a merchant action or to illustrate growth.\n\n![Diagram presenting the success color role, with mainly green colors](/images/color-role-success@2x.png)\n\n### Warning\n\nWarning colors let the merchant know they need to take action, and are applied to badges, banners, and exception lists.\n\n![Diagram presenting the warning color role, with mainly yellow and orange colors](/images/color-role-warning@2x.png)\n\n### Critical\n\nCritical colors are for destructive interactive elements, errors, and critical events that require immediate action.\n\n![Diagram presenting the critical color role, with mainly red colors](/images/color-role-critical@2x.png)\n\n### Highlight\n\nHighlight colors indicate important elements that don’t require immediate action. They’re used with informational banners and badges, indicators that draw attention to new information, loading or progress bars, and data visualization.\n\n![Diagram presenting the highlight color role, with mainly cyan and teal colors](/images/color-role-highlight@2x.png)\n\n### Decorative\n\nDecorative colors are for expressive communications that assert the Shopify brand presence.\n\n![Diagram presenting the decorative color role, with a variety of colors like yellow, turquoise and rose](/images/color-role-decorative@2x.png)',

          'This section outlines data visualization practices at Shopify and how to leverage them.\n\n---\n\n## Data visualizations at Shopify\n\nThe data visualization process always begins with a set of data, a question, and analysis of the data to find the answer. Each visualization should focus on answering a single question about the dataset. For example, “What are my sales over time?”\n\nBy maintaining consistent styles and formats for our data visualizations, we ensure that data is presented in a truthful and accurate manner to maintain integrity with merchants.\n\n---\n\n## Guidelines\n\nData visualization should be approached by:\n\n### Solving a problem\n\nHave a clear question that needs to be answered. If multiple answers to multiple questions are illustrated in a visualization, it will become over complicated and hard to understand.\n\n### Testing with real data\n\nTesting with real data will reveal the effectiveness of the visualization. Also test when there are a few data points (one or two) or many data points (100 or more).\n\n### Scaling by number of datapoints\n\nThink about how the visualization will scale with more or fewer data points. Look out for cases where data is sparse (mostly zero) or spiky (some values are much\nlarger than others).\n\n---\n\n## Five core traits\n\nAn effective data visualization strikes the right balance between the five core traits: accuracy, intuitiveness, engagement, focus, and data granularity. It’s important to be intentional about which of these you focus on, and which are less important, in order to answer your specific question in the best way for your target audience. Understanding these traits help you choose between the many ways to visualize data by giving you a language for evaluating a visualization\'s effectiveness.\n\n### Accuracy\n\nAccuracy is about how faithfully the visualization matches the original data set. How much accuracy is needed to send your message across? A high level of accuracy may not always be needed to convey a trend or a pattern.\n\n### Intuitiveness\n\nIntuitiveness is about the ease of interpreting the visualization. Will merchants immediately understand what’s being represented, or will they need instructions? More intuitive is usually better, but sometimes it comes at the cost of flexibility.\n\n### Engagement\n\nEngagement is about how much attention the visualization attracts at a glance. Is it the star of the show, or does it sit in the background? More engagement is not always better—sometimes the best visualization is one that plays a supporting role.\n\n### Focus\n\nFocus is about how merchants’ attention is directed. Is one pattern or trend surfaced more prominently than others, or are there several trends that are given equal weight? Highly focused visualizations decrease cognitive overload, but restrict the breadth of the message you are able to convey.\n\n### Data Granularity\n\nData granularity is about the level of detail of the data set presented in the visualization. More granular means more data points, and possibly more cognitive processing, but less granular is less detailed. The right level of data granularity depends entirely on the specific question you’re trying to answer and the audience you’re communicating to.\n\n---\n\n## Axis and labelling conventions\n\nAll standard charts that show quantitative data have 2 axes that should be labeled for clarity.\n\n- Labelling should be outside and separate from the data area. This ensures the user understands the range of the data without taking focus away from the data.\n- Ensure that all labels are clear and accurate in what they represent. Use simple and short language.\n\n---\n\n## Granular guidelines\n\n### Axis lines\n\nAxis lines should be used as a guideline to show quantitative data, yet be unobtrusive.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\nEnsure axis lines only appear where the data appears.\n\n![A light grey chart with axis lines](/images/ensure-axis-lines-only-appear-where-data-appears@2x.png)\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\nUse bleeding axis lines to the edge of the screen.\n\n![A chart with axis lines filling the screen](/images/use-bleeding-axis-lines-to-the-edge-of-the-screen@2x.png)\n\n</div></div>\n\n### Skipping labels\n\nLabelling the tick marks on both the y-axis and x-axis helps the visualization become more clear in what it represents.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\nSkip labels in regular intervals.\n\n![A bar chart plotting time using 12am, 8am, 12pm, and 8pm](/images/skip-labels-in-regular-intervals@2x.png)\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\nTry to squeeze all labels together.\n\n![A chart plotting time with too many axis labels](/images/squeeze-all-labels-together@2x.png)\n\n</div></div>\n\n### X-axis Abbreviations\n\nShopify uses standard abbreviations for months and weekdays in order to reduce clutter in visualizations.\n\n- Use 12 hour format for time, with lowercase letters (12am, 6pm)\n- Use the first three letters for days of the week (Sun, Mon)\n- Use the first three letters for months (Feb, Mar)\n- For specific days, use the format ‘day + month’ (10 Apr, 11 Apr)\n- For specific months, use the format month + year (Apr 2011, May 2017)\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\nUse standard abbreviations for labeling.\n\n![A chart showing the days of the week abbreviated to Mon, Tues, and so on](/images/use-standard-abbreviations-for-labeling2@2x.png)\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\nSlant labels to make them fit.\n\n![A chart with labels slanted at a 45 degree angle](/images/slant-labels-to-make-them-fit2@2x.png)\n\n</div></div>\n\n### Y-Axis Abbreviations\n\nShopify uses standard monetary abbreviations for the y-axis to reduce clutter.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\nAbbreviate using ‘k’ for thousand, ‘b’ for billion.\n\n![A chart with a y-axis representing a thousand dollars as “$1.0k”](/images/abbreviate-using-k-for-thousand-b-for-billion-and-include-the-unit@2x.png)\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\nGo over 3 numeric characters, 1 decimal, or 1 letter.\n\n![A chart with a y-axis that represents the value of a thousand and one dollars as “$1.001k”](/images/go-over-3-numeric-characters-1-decimal-and-1-single-letter@2x.png)\n\n</div></div>\n\n### X-axis Labelling conventions\n\nLabels should be clear and concise.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\nCenter all labels on the bar and the tick mark.\n\n![A bar chart with the abbreviated days of the week centered on the ticks which are centered on the bars that they represent](/images/center-all-labels-with-the-bar-and-tick2@2x.png)\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\nUse decimals on the x-axis labels.\n\n![A bar chart plotting numbers with decimals on the x-axis](/images/use-decimals-on-x-axis-labels2@2x.png)\n\n</div></div>\n\n### Y-axis Labelling conventions\n\nLabels should be clear and concise.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\nLeft align labels and keep them above y-axis lines.\n\n![A chart with a dollar value on the y-axis that’s aligned to the left and raised slightly from the grey axis](/images/left-align-labels-and-keep-them-slightly-above-the-y-axis-lines@2x.png)\n\n</div></div>\n\n---\n\n## Color palettes\n\nColor in data visualization has a very specific meaning. The data visualization color palette provides specific colors that can be used alone or in a group, depending on the intent.\n\n### Single data series\n\nUse when there is a single data series. For example, a bar chart, column chart, or a single line chart.\n\n![A line graph with y-axis and x-axis labels and a single purple line plotting data](/images/single-data-series@2x.png)\n\n![A line chart with 2 different colors comparing current values to a past value](/images/single-comparison-to-past@2x.png)\n\n### Single comparison to past\n\nThis is used when the data set is being compared to to its past values. For example, total sales by month, this year, compared to last year. In this case, the current value will be purple and the past value will be grey.\n\n### Multiseries data\n\nUsed when there are multiple data sets to compare. For example, a multiseries line chart. Go down the list as the number of datasets increase.\n\n![A line chart with multiple data points represented by different colors](/images/multiseries-data@2x.png)\n\n![One example of an upward trend in percentage sales represented in gren and another example of a downward trend in](/images/biased-charts@2x.png)\n\n### Biased\n\nUsed when certain data need is displayed in a negative or positive light. For example, showing positive or negative change relative to a reference value.\n\n---\n\n## Horizontal bar charts\n\nBar charts are used for comparing discrete categories. Use a bar chart when there is a constraint to the number of data points that can appear on the visualization, otherwise it becomes hard to scale.\n\n### Best used for\n\nShowing discrete categories of data, like {products} vs {sales}.\n\n### Don’t use\n\nWhen the number of data points can exceed 6. In this case, use a table.\n\n### Bar chart labels\n\nLabel each bar with what it’s displaying, as well as the value. For more best practices, visit axis and label conventions.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\nInclude a label on each bar. If the bar is too small, include it outside of the bar.\n\n![A horizontal bar chart with 2 dollar values within the bar and the lowest value outside of the bar to the right](/images/include-a-label-on-each-bar-if-the-bar-is-too-small-include-it-outside-of-the-bar@2x.png)\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\nInclude a label on top of each bar to display what data it’s showing.\n\n![A horizontal bar chart displaying the country represented by each bar](/images/include-a-label-on-top-of-each-bar-to-display-what-data-it-is-showing@2x.png)\n\n</div></div>\n\n### Color\n\nUse one color for all bars.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\nGive negative bars 60% opacity.\n\n![A horizontal bar chart with solid purple positive bars and purple negative bars set to 60% opacity](/images/give-negative-bars-60-opacity@2x.png)\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\nUse multiple colors for the bars.\n\n![A horizontal bar chart using a different color for each bar](/images/use-multiple-colors-for-the-bars@2x.png)\n\n</div></div>\n\n### Bar positioning\n\nMake sure the bars are proportional in width, roughly twice the size of the space between the bars.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\nMake the width of each bar about twice as wide as the space between them.\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\nMake the bars too skinny.\n\n</div></div>\n\n---\n\n## Vertical column charts\n\nColumn charts are used to show change over time, trends, and individual data points. Use column charts for when the number of data points is fewer than 30, or else use a line chart.\n\n### Best used for\n\n- Showing continuous data like sales per hour, or orders per month\n- Showing smaller granularities of time (hourly, daily, weekly, and monthly)\n\n### Don’t use\n\nWhen the number of data points can exceed 31. In this case, use a [line chart](/design/data-visualizations#line-charts).\n\n### Color\n\nAll bars should be the same color.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\nUse one color for all bars.\n\n![A bar chart showing a data trend with the same bar color](/images/use-one-color-for-all-bars@2x.png)\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\nUse multiple colors for the bars.\n\n![A bar chart showing the same data point with different colors](/images/use-multiple-colors-for-the-bars2@2x.png)\n\n</div></div>\n\n### Bar positioning\n\nMake sure the bars are proportional in width, roughly twice the size of the space between the bars.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\nMake the width of each bar about twice as wide as the space between them.\n\n![A bar chart properly formatted with spaces half the size of each bar](/images/make-the-width-of-each-bar-about-twice-the-space-between-them@2x.png)\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\nMake the bars too skinny.\n\n![A bar chart with spaces 4 times larger than the bar itself](/images/make-the-bars-too-skinny@2x.png)\n\n</div></div>\n\n### Interactivity\n\nInclude some interactivity on the bars upon hover since users will be looking at individual data points. The top line of the tooltip should follow x-axis abbreviation and labelling guidelines, while the bottom line tooltip should follow y-axis abbreviation and labelling guidelines.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\nInclude tooltips for x-axis and y-axis values.\n\n![A bar chart with a tool tip on a bar displaying the date axis point and the dollar value axis point](/images/include-tooltips-with-both-the-x-axis-value-and-y-axis-value@2x.png)\n\n</div></div>\n\n---\n\n## Line charts\n\nA line chart is created by connecting a series of data points together with a line. Line charts are good to show change over time, comparisons, and trends. Use line charts when the number of data points is more than 30.\n\n### Best used for\n\n- Showing continuous data like sales or orders over time\n- Showing larger granularities of time (yearly, or quarterly)\n- Spotting overall trends and shapes of data\n\n### Axis and labelling\n\nSet up the chart area using the [axis and labelling guidelines](/design/data-visualizations#axis-and-labelling-conventions)\n\n---\n\n## Multiline charts\n\nLine graphs work well when multiple datasets need to be compared. Use the [color palette](/design/colors#color-palette) to select colors.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\nUse contrasting color and include a legend.\n\n![A line chart with 2 lines using purple and teal to represent the years 2015 and 2016](/images/use-contrasting-colors-and-include-a-legend@2x.png)\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\nUse more than 4 lines.\n\n![A line chart with 4 lines of different colors](/images/use-more-than-4-lines-try-to-stick-to-2-lines@2x.png)\n\n</div></div>\n\n---\n\n## Display metrics\n\nA display metric is a quantifiable measure that is used to track and display the status of a specific process. Examples include a sum, an average, or a movement in a positive or negative direction.\n\n### Best used for\n\nShowing a single value with a base unit.\n\n### Units\n\nMetrics should be paired with their base unit in close proximity to the number. Use concise and clear language for metrics.\n\n### Scope\n\nMetrics should be scoped to indicate the timeline of the data.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\nInclude a dimension of time to scope the value.\n\n![Diagram showing “sales this week” with a numeric dollar value](/images/include-a-dimension-of-time-to-scope-the-value@2x.png)\n\n</div></div>\n\n### Movement\n\nIf needed, consider including a comparison indicator, such as comparison to the previous time or average.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\nUse green for positive movement.\n\n![Diagram of green being used to signify an upward trend in data](/images/use-green-to-signify-positive-movement@2x.png)\n\nUse red for negative movement.\n\n![Diagram of red being used to signify a downward trend in data](/images/use-red-to-signify-negative-movement@2x.png)\n\n</div></div>\n\n---\n\n## Tables\n\nA table is a good way to showcase a large amount of information which has a variety of columns and data to show for each entity. A table should be used when multiple metrics and categories need to be presented together, and accurate lookup of the data values is more important that showing patterns in the data.\n\n### Best used for\n\n- Showing large amounts of discrete data with many variables\n- Showing values across multiple categories and measures\n- Allowing for filtering and ordering when comparison is not a priority\n\n### Alignment\n\nConsistent vertical alignment is essential for fast visual comparison between values in a table.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\nLeft align non-numeric values and right align numeric values.\n\n![A table showing product inventory with product names aligned to the left and numbers aligned to the right](/images/left-align-non-numeric-values-and-right-align-numeric-values@2x.png)\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\nCenter column headers.\n\n![A table showing product inventory data with headers, numbers, and titles centered](/images/center-align-columns@2x.png)\n\n</div></div>\n\n### Separation\n\nIn order to reduce clutter and non-data ink, we prefer to subtly separate each row.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\nUse light lines to indicate separation between rows.\n\n![A table with three rows separated by light grey lines](/images/separate-rows-with-dividing-lines@2x.png)\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\nHighlight every other row to indicate separation.\n\n![A table with a white background and grey lines using a darker grey every other row](/images/separate-rows-by-highlighting-every-other-row@2x.png)\n\n</div></div>\n\n### Totals\n\nTotals allow merchants to understand the data holistically and should be easy to find.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\nPlace totals as the first row beneath the headers, and bold the text.\n\n![A diagram showing individual product sales underneath the total sales in bold type](/images/place-bold-totals-in-the-first-row@2x.png)\n\n</div></div>\n\n---\n\n## Accessibility\n\nAn important part of designing clear visualizations is making data accessible to everyone.\n\n### Provide options\n\nMerchants with vision issues might have trouble understanding visual presentations of data, even with assistive software.\n\nMerchants with dexterity or motor issues might have trouble using interactive visualizations that depend on fine motor control.\n\nOthers might simply have trouble understanding data presented in a chart or graph.\n\nTo support the needs of different merchants, always provide multiple formats for data visualizations.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\nLet merchants access their data in multiple formats. For charts and graphs, it’s often helpful to offer the same content in a data table that’s either on the same page or on a related page that’s easy to discover.\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\nProvide data visualizations in only one format.\n\n</div></div>\n\n### Use of color\n\nColor is critical for visualization, but can cause issues for merchants with color blindness and low vision. Color should be used in a way that supports the interpretation of visual information for all merchants, including those with visual issues.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\nEnsure that text, line, bar, and other colors have sufficient contrast against their background.\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\nUse colors that can be distinguished from each other to support merchants with different forms of [color blindness](https://webaim.org/articles/visual/colorblind).\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\nRequire that merchants are able to see color to understand the information provided in the chart or graph.\n\n</div></div>\n\nTo learn more, see guidance about [accessible colors in Polaris](https://polaris.shopify.com/design/colors#colors-follow-accessibility-guidelines).\n\n### Scalable vector graphics (SVGs)\n\n`<svg>` and `<canvas>` elements are excellent tools for creating engaging, dynamic visualizations in HTML. However, they are frequently difficult to access using assistive technologies. Assistive technology users may not be able to access content in the correct order, find text equivalents for visual information, or access interactions with the keyboard.\n\nIn general, hide `<svg>` elements from screen readers using `aria-hidden="true"` and provide a separate text equivalent for the graph or chart. Although different visualizations may benefit from different treatments, try to prioritize creating a consistent experience.',

          '![A collection of various icons used in the Shopify Admin.](/images/icons-intro@2x.png)\n\n---\n\n## Principles\n\n### Simple over detailed\n\nDetailed icons increase cognitive load. Focus on simplicity to help merchants understand the concept the icon represents and recognize icons on smaller screens.\n\n### Literally literal\n\nLiteral symbols are easier to understand than abstract symbols. When possible, use symbols that represent the most basic idea or concept instead of a metaphorical one. If the concept can’t be conveyed literally (an activity like gardening, a profession like doctor), pick a logically related symbol (shovel, stethoscope).\n\n### Stay professional\n\nThe design of an icon communicates tone, much like the content it’s paired with. Focus on the effectiveness of the message instead of its ability to delight. In other words, prioritize representing the function, rather than how nice it looks.\n\n---\n\n## Creating icons\n\n![Five icons in order: a trash can to represent a delete action, a cogwheel to represent settings, a spyglass to represent search, a pin to represent location and a bell to represent notifications.](/images/icons-established@2x.png)\n\n### Use established icons\n\nIcons that have been used for a long time worldwide have a higher chance of being recognized and understood quickly. Don’t reinvent an icon that’s already been accepted as the convention. There are global, established conventions for concepts like “delete,” “settings,” and “search.” These symbols are effective, and don’t need to be redefined.\n\n![An icon of a cogwheel that represents Store, Product, and global settings.](/images/icons-limit-variations@2x.png)\n\n### Limit variations\n\nUse a single icon to represent variations of the same concept. Shipping settings, store settings, account settings, and any new settings should use the cog icon. Don’t create a custom icon for each of these concepts—it bloats the icon library and makes it difficult for merchants to create strong connections around a concept.\n\n![Various icons paired with text, notably the icon of a house with the word "Home", the icon of a computer with the word "Desktop" and an icon of an arrow pointing up and another pointing down with the word "Sort".](/images/icons-pairing@2x.png)\n\n### Pair icons with text\n\nThe purpose of an icon is to clarify the content by providing a visual cue and improve legibility and scannability of the user interface. In general, icons should be placed near a label or title. Never use an icon to replace a name of a product or feature—the rare exception being an icon that’s a universally understood action, like the trash can icon that represents deletions.\n\n![Five icons representing the currency of different countries: a dollar, a euro, a british pound, an indian rupee and a japanese yen.](/images/icons-internationalization@2x.png)\n\n### Keep internationalization in mind\n\nWhenever possible, use a universally recognized icon. However, there will be times where only a locally understood icon will work to communicate a concept. When deciding what symbol should be used, check that it will be understood at a glance by people from different cultures and backgrounds.\n\n---\n\n## When to use icons\n\nIcons are powerful visual helpers and should be used with care. Overuse quickly results in user interfaces that are visually overwhelming or distracting.\nIcons are commonly used:\n\n- In primary navigation\n- In page headers and section titles\n- In banners to bring attention to a specific theme, such as an announcement or an error\n- Inline with text to add clarity\n- To direct attention to something the merchant can take action on\n\nTo browse all available icons, visit the [Icons library](https://polaris.shopify.com/icons).\n\n## System icons\n\nSystem icons help merchants find their way around and shouldn’t be ornamental. They’re smaller than spot icons because they’re always applied in product experiences where it’s important that they complement the user experience and not overpower it. They should represent a specific action, object, or concept.\n\n![Icons in a navigation menu.](/images/icons-system-20@2x.png)\n\n### Major icons—20×20\n\nMajor system icons are:\n\n- Primarily used in navigation to support wayfinding\n- Used to help promote, reinforce, or draw special attention to a specific area or metaphor\n- 20×20 in size\n- Within a 20×20 bounding box\n\n![Smaller icons in a drop-down menu](/images/icons-system-16@2x.png)\n\n### Minor icons—16×16\n\nMinor system icons are:\n\n- Used inline to add clarity to an action\n- Used in form elements (`<input>`, `<button>`, etc.)\n- 16×16 in size\n- Within a 20×20 bounding box\n\n---\n\n## Spot icons\n\n![Larger, spot icons of a spyglass for a "results not found" error, an upwards arrow for a file upload card, and an exclamation point for a "page not found" error.](/images/icons-spot@2x.png)\n\nSpot icons reinforce messaging in product experiences that are seen more than once. Spot&nbsp;icons&nbsp;are:\n\n- Bigger than system icons and have a stronger stroke weight to add visual balance to the layout\n- 60×60 in size\n- Within a 60×60 bounding box',

It provides context, adds clarity, or leads to the next step. It gives merchants a deeper understanding of what they’re working on.\n\n### Keep it in the family\n\nIllustrations are all part of the same visual family. Inconsistencies lower the overall quality of the experience, and can distract merchants or make them feel like they’re in the wrong place.\n\n### Be considerate\n\nIllustration should understand and support the merchant’s experience. Each illustration needs to feel appropriate for whatever situation it shows up in.\n\n### Stay focused\n\nEach illustration conveys one thing. The story is easy to understand, so merchants intuitively know how to accomplish whatever they came here to do.\n\n---\n\n## Elements of style\n\n![A color palette and illustrations using the color palette](/images/illustrations-color@2x.png)\n\n### Color\n\nIllustrations use a special set of colors designed to work well in the places where they show up. The palette is limited: individual illustrations use whites, grays, and two or three colors each. Colors are also less saturated than the surrounding UI, so they don’t distract from core interactions.\n\n![Illustrations of a flag, a teapot, a leaf, and various profiles of people of different ethnicities.](/images/illustrations-shape@2x.png)\n\n### Shape\n\nObjects have realistic proportions so they’re easy to recognize. Simple geometric shapes with rounded corners build images that are clear and approachable. Representations of people use more organic shapes.\n\n![An illustration of a laptop and an illustration of shipping boxes separated on a white background](/images/illustrations-space@2x.png)\n\n### Space\n\nThe perspective is flat and two-dimensional so the entire area of the illustration is of equal importance. Drop shadows give things subtle depth when necessary. An additional side of an object can be added if things aren’t easily recognizable from a single side.\n\nEach illustration has negative space around it so it feels balanced in the place it lives, and so its visual weight is the same as other illustrations that live in the same places.\n\n![An stylized illustration of a chair with red lines defining its angles, next to an illustration of the profile of a person, with red lines to emphasize where curves are used.](/images/illustrations-line@2x.png)\n\n### Line\n\nLine makes and arranges shapes in the space. All illustrations have smooth lines without texture. Smaller objects have straighter lines, while larger objects can have more detailed, curved lines.\n\nIntersecting and continuous lines are a key element of the admin illustration style, but they aren’t forced. They make a simple illustration feel elegant and visually interesting without being distracting.\n\n![An intricate illustration of a shipping label, followed by an illustration of a sheet with a list of users, followed by a very simple illustration of an URL address bar.](/images/illustrations-detail@2x.png)\n\n### Detail\n\nIllustrations need some detail to make sense, but too much can be noisy. They have the minimum amount of detail necessary to make them feel realistic but still simple. Fine details are rarely smaller than 4px in height or width.\n\n---\n\n## Where illustrations live\n\nThere are places where illustrations always appear, and places where they’re used only sometimes.\n\n![An illustration of scissors cutting a coupon to indicate a page for discount code administration that has no discount codes saved.](/images/illustrations-empty-states@2x.png)\n\n### Empty states\n\nMerchants see an empty state illustration the first time they access a new part of the experience, before they’ve had the chance to do anything there yet. It introduces what they can do here, and sets expectations for what’s ahead.\n\n![An admin homecard with a small illustration next to some text describing how to customize a theme.](/images/illustrations-onboarding@2x.png)\n\n### Onboarding\n\nOnboarding tasks help new merchants set up their store. Illustrations frame what each task is for. And by changing in appearance, they reinforce when a task is complete.\n\n![An illustration celebrating a store anniversary.](/images/illustrations-announcements@2x.png)\n\n### Announcements\n\nAnnouncements let merchants know about something that might help their business. When the announcement celebrates a major merchant milestone or introduces an important product, illustration helps make it special or noticeable.\n\n![An illustration next to a card talking about Shopify Payments.](/images/illustrations-spot@2x.png)\n\n### Spot illustrations\n\nIn some rare instances, unique spot illustrations can be used to achieve a specific goal, like to draw attention to something important on a busy page, or to explain a technical concept.',

Avoid elaborate transitions that create visual noise or intense color changes. Distracting animation can create disturbance and make an interface unpleasant to use.\n\n### Keep things consistent\n\nConsistent treatments for interaction feedback create recognizable patterns. If an interaction produces different feedback across the Shopify admin, it deteriorates the integrity of the pattern and risks confusing merchants.\n\n---\n\n## Designing interaction states\n\nKeep in mind that merchants interact with interfaces differently depending which input device they’re using. Devices they may be using include:\n\n### Input devices to consider\n\n- Mouse\n- Touch screen\n- Keyboard\n- Voice\n- Game controller\n- Refreshable braille display\n\nTo learn more, check out the [accessibility guidelines](/foundations/accessibility).\n\n### Use signifiers\n\nProvide merchants with cues as to what the interface will do if they interact with it. By using signifiers we set expectations about what components can do, which creates a more intuitive interface that’s easier to use. The types of signifiers include:\n\n![A "sort" button in a default state.](/images/interaction-states-explicit@2x.png)\n\n**Explicit**, where content directs merchants to do the intended action, such as “Sort” or “Save.”\n\n![An "edit" button with its underline appearing when the mouse hovers above it.](/images/interaction-states-hidden@2x.png)\n\n**Hidden**, where the clue isn’t revealed until the merchant interacts with it, such as hovering or using tab navigation to see if a button is clickable.\n\n![A "print packing slip" button that is grayed out and inactive.](/images/interaction-states-negative@2x.png)\n\n**Negative**, where the action appears inactive (like the button is grayed out and doesn’t respond to hover) because it isn’t available for the merchant to use.\n\n![A toast component, a button with a spinner component and a text field component with an error message.](/images/interaction-states-behavior@2x.png)\n\n### Behavior\n\n**Use feedback indicators** like the [progress bar](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/progress-bar) component or the [spinner](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/spinner) component to let them know that the interface received their request. If appropriate, you can also provide added information about what or how long it will take to complete.\n\n**For non-disruptive feedback** on the outcome of an action, use the [toast](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/feedback-indicators/toast) component.\n\n**For an unsuccessful completion** that requires the merchant to take action, provide information about what prevented the action from completing successfully and what the merchant can do to fix the problem. For example, use the validation error state of the [text field](https://polaris.shopify.com/components/selection-and-input/text-field) component.',

They create consistent layouts across all components and pages of an application. Developers can use these components to quickly create flexible pages and features without worrying about the underlying structure or CSS code.\n\nEach layout component encapsulates CSS styles commonly found in the Shopify admin. Passing different values to the component props will render different CSS styles.\n\nYou can browse all [layout and structure components](/components/layout-and-structure), as well as view usage guidelines and examples for each component.\n\n---\n\n## Layout components vs writing CSS\n\nPolaris layout components provide several benefits over writing layout CSS code:\n\n- **Consistency.** Layout components suggest standard layout and spacing, unifying the Shopify admin experience.\n- **Reusability.** Create new pages and components with these layout building blocks, and avoid rewriting the same CSS code.\n- **Maintainability.** CSS code is abstracted away, simplifying how you update layout and spacing. There’s also reduced risk of errors and breaking styles.\n- **Reliability.** Reducing redundant CSS through layout components improves site performance for merchants.\n- **Faster development.** Stop writing CSS code from scratch, and focus on the logic and functionality of your application.\n\n## Guiding behaviors\n\nLayout components are intended to solve about 80% of layout use cases. But they won’t solve everything. For unique cases, leverage [Polaris design tokens](/tokens/colors) to write your own CSS styles. When building with layout components, keep the following behaviors and limitations in mind.\n\n<div as="SideBySide">\n\n- <span>**Layout components are single purpose, composable, and flexible.** Single-purpose components allow us to separate concerns and predict behavior when the design system changes. A known tradeoff can be extra elements in the markup. <br /><br />Combine these components to build any layout. Their flexibility means different combinations can achieve the same visual result.</span> ![Card, Columns, Divider, and Inline components assembled together to create admin UI element](/images/single-purpose-composible-flexible@2x.png)\n- <span>**Layout components shouldn’t affect anything outside of their borders.** They should only impact components rendered inside of them. The exception is the [Bleed](/components/layout-and-structure/bleed) component.</span> ![Admin card with whitespace between each UI element](/images/outside-borders@2x.png)\n- <span>**Layout components have a default spacing of 0.** There isn’t a perfect default, so add spacing with intention. For more information, refer to the [Space](/design/space) guide.</span> ![Admin card with the padding around and between the elements increased](/images/default-spacing@2x.png)\n- <span>**Layout component behaviors rely on Polaris tokens.** Behaviors like spacing, color, and breakpoints are configured via component prop APIs. Each prop expects a specific value that maps to a [Polaris design token](/tokens/colors).</span> ![Admin UI element with color and spacing design tokens called out](/images/tokens@2x.png)\n\n</div>\n\n## Breakpoints and spacing\n\nAll layout components use the breakpoint scale and tokens. Consequently, consider how spacing can affect a layout, depending on screen size. On smaller screens, elements will be tighter. On medium to large screens, cards will be side by side and have more room.\n\nTo ensure designs are responsive, reference the breakpoints and examples in the Polaris [Space](/design/space) documentation.\n\n<video width="100%" height="auto" controls autoplay muted loop>\n  <source src="/images/breakpoints.mp4" type="video/mp4">\n  <p>Browser window resizing with the overlayed column grid dynamically adjusting to the size</p>\n</video>\n\n## Layout component examples\n\nThe following examples illustrate how the new layout components can be composed together to create admin UI elements. Each example is just one approach to building that particular UI, but many other combinations of layout components can result in the same outcome. To get more comfortable, try rebuilding these same UIs using a different combination of layout components.\n\n### Example 1\n\nAdmin UI card with a horizontal dot button on one side, plus text and a button on the opposite side\n\n![](/images/example1.png)\n\n[View Polaris Sandbox](https://polaris.shopify.com/sandbox?code=N4Igxg9gJgpiBcIA8AhCAPABABwIZSgEsA7AcwF4AdEANmoD5LjNMkBBAG2wAtcBhXACcojZi0zAA9ACppmJuPEAVbjEylc2HIIhaAzjAAuezIdWY9eMGoBGRgO4wYzGLjDdM7whyiYSp804eXABlQzcAa0w%2BCABbbAhiZ0MFRXVNTDdrbGNMCABXQQsrElJMWD1CUmZDCAjnE1wTADdcDnyYE25DQ2w9eElJBI4hQj0AOj1uXUIAMwBPcchYyVr64j1JSzdS1MVZSQBfPdYg3jDI9OwqEAAmakxZ-I4OAHVCKDNRRSlZE5YYu1Yhs-CYbPlvIZMPZCGZoiEQupBB9MPliLAimY1NNoJl0ZkwNlcnwEUiUbgesjwYZOv9HhBMeZIECQdgdNg6QdjmJFEhAflgSZmQKNjcAIyzIq4fK1Bh0lhIJQwdBQpo3DkgTCtZG4YiGG6qfClACyUDlPLSLAAmgUiokOCQ1HpaoI1GNiIBMAihumcmHmRnlrEkSpV30trBQMtqzGwI38hEgxHIwAAEgzCAAvRLhDgAEQgxmNJAZh3oSEkkZ6iTDvMk-MFNfEiuVqr06vN4cw%2Bc9UNmDNIRlMEEwrtiEGaaixOCaensDN89lUzHmBQ9rpHrig8yHFnCghSFsUBhepXGdPLIcMjfLZ1C4TAEUbvzpaCwpEIE5MK-yBOsehMtSYLEurbiSiJsj6%2B6EJ0eK%2BFkMA5CYtrlJ0VQ1HUDTyIe9JFM68wOmQmSUoQ1KdOMmAAJKGAA5EhhRARAzpajAgh6BS3hqCM35QssCRJHqnJHCcqAYNOBClCgHAQA%2BFz7jcAAsHZpKgUbVgASjAY4TpgAAKM5zsI5aVtG14VhgYY3lwvACMIohGeZTAgAANCAWKxJ0CAANogFJYBtDA8DOCAAC6Lkwp83B6F5ADsNAABzBYcQA)\n\n### Example 2\n\nAdmin UI card with stacked elements, inline links, and a divider\n\n![](/images/example2.png)\n\n[View Polaris sandbox](https://polaris.shopify.com/playroom/index.html?code=N4Igxg9gJgpiBcIA8AhCAPABABwIZSgEsA7AcwF4AdEADmoD5LjNMkBBAG2wAtcBhXACcojZi1aceuAMoAXXGADWmUrmxUQAFgZNx4pABUY6WZlwBnDdwBM1TADchhXMVlWY%2BEqQCyUHWL0WAAUAVwAjDkJzbhgoTA4XUhDcUhhzXUCkAHojE1FA1lzTCw1sO0gOCEENc3CoENj-ApY2MFlCexhMEkxZGMwAWyFFGFlzXpiATwByTswwmBhmfFg42QgzYjj7KMIIrvXMMBDzdYGYQXMAOgy9bKL8zJQORbihwVISAEliSOIYDQAViazSQABEOoRYIJMFlHncss9XvD9D8-l1cJFSMQangwDAALQLWQAd0WxBBBSQaJIXVU6mo2hAKKpRTMlmoZRAmAAZhBXAB1GCEUjcNzUcwwAZ7CAcPzM27NFgAUTIkWiiqpOWMsnowDs1AAvpqnvhUvQwTAebgQhxZNkUGaYCz9Fkaf8XSwkAAZEiKeh8XhkLqwa22%2B1ZX3Ef0m7Lu52xpGxQZCT7EeNAuzvNPPCBKVVQTMKgJPDAmvRhBSKUiCCAhLYaStKGt1rbUcviPAELwaJkdlhhKrQ3NKORCcUgIg7aHtksFQfCC4AJU8JwLY8EE9sIH78yHy9X5gLBY0247nv0bJKnMpSswQVrA2wpmOpwg50u3WYtWw2CqsmTQQYE%2BflxkOaIIGwL8JmFGFKjATFdxYBIyGSVJMBOLwYNYKN-WkbhIMIHlJkwABxGBZTzXB2n5TA2F-bJcPoG450ybU8g7B0MBdB0XliFFskkXgxyUR5BK4XgBGEUQuPQUQQAAGhAPopTSBAAG0QHgzEYHgJYQAAXSUkkoT6cwNIAdgANhoAzDSAA)\n\n### Example 3\n\nAdmin UI card with text on one side, and a button on the opposite side\n\n![](/images/example3.png)\n\n[View Polaris sanbox](https://polaris.shopify.com/playroom/index.html?code=N4Igxg9gJgpiBcIA8AFAhgcxgPgDoDsACQpAQQBsAHACzQGUAXNMAa0IzUoF5cQAOXniLESFGmgDCaAE5QhIkUgCS%2BcgEt8MQmnUZ8PEAGdKzGAFoARjAYB3GDHy9CF8hFYU1eg2AcMY0pw5uXgAWQQIFBSQAFRgADwZ5SIVSMAY1ADc0P0IGajVDQlcwbLUIIjUAM0I1BgByQqsNDEIAV0MYKEJKiGlCQwY3Fmaa-AzfXoBPABoI5JFK1vJKtXJ1fBbe2GlDacJe-pg1kcppaFa0wznkpAB6WISkm4AhVoZB-GxU9Kyc4tLyndXu9yk9FLcVOscNcSLcxLQpLIknd4fQmKwhHd0FghCBpiA8jAALYwQwIADaIH%2B5Bg8AcIAAuvibGooHkyfByQB2ABsfGmAEYAAwhIUMgC%2BQA)',

          '![Visual representation of sound waves as concentric circles](/images/sound-intro@2x.png)\n\n---\n\n## Principles\n\n### Selectively urgent\n\nThe duration, volume, and character of a sound should all be dictated by the level of urgency of an event. For example, an alert indicating that a customer is struggling to complete checkout requires more urgent attention and immediate action. An alert indicating that a customer has arrived at a storefront is informative, but doesn’t require immediate action. The sounds used during these events should be customized to reflect the differences in urgency.\n\n### Avoid annoying repetition\n\nSome sounds occur many times per day. While appealing on first listen, a sound may become irritating after ten, and unbearable after a hundred. Merchants that hear a sound repeatedly may quickly grow tired of it. **Our sounds should be informative and not annoying.** When possible, use data to determine how often a sound is triggered.\n\n### Distinct and succinct\n\nMerchants are likely to hear our sounds in a variety of contexts. Clean, focused, and succinct sounds convey information better than muffled or distorted sounds.\n\n### Test across devices\n\nWhile you may be testing your designs using headphones or loudspeakers that reveal the audible frequency spectrum clearly, a smartphone speaker will affect the quality of the sound. Smaller speakers are more susceptible to distortion. Sounds on mobile devices should be played at lower levels than on a desktop computer or laptop. Test sounds on a variety of devices and volume&nbsp;levels.\n\n### Think beyond sound\n\nSome people can’t rely on sound to receive cues or notifications. Merchants may have a disability that affects hearing or auditory processing. Depending on the merchant’s preferences and technologies, they may receive sound cues through haptic or visual feedback, but don’t assume that they’ll be able to perceive sound. Always include an alternative method to convey information, like text-based notifications or visual changes in the interface.\n\n---\n\n## When to use sound\n\nSounds in our product help convey information. There’s an important balance between having too many sounds and not enough. Useful and well-planned sounds will help with merchant understanding. Unnecessary sounds will reduce the perceived quality of our product.\n\nEven though merchants might miss important information if they turn off their sound, we should always provide the option for them to do so.\n\n### Common sound events\n\n- For an event that requires a merchant’s immediate attention, use an alert to encourage them to pause their workflow and take care of things.\n- For something that’s useful for a merchant to do, but not necessarily immediately, use a notification.\n- To confirm success, use feedback for a successful action.\n- For statement of failure, use feedback for unsuccessful action.\n\n---\n\n## How to approach sound design\n\nBe creative and intentional with your sound design. And remember:\n\n- Short sounds should be no longer than 250ms, long sounds no longer than 1 second.\n- Sounds should be in the same “family.” If you introduce a new note, key, or timbre, make sure there’s a good reason.\n- Create two versions of every sound:\n  - A louder version for desktop applications.\n  - A quieter version for mobile applications where the speakers are smaller and may distort more easily.\n\nDesign sounds with as much intentionality as other design aspects of Shopify’s products.',

Be harmonious\n\nUse Polaris space tokens in a way that is consistent with the rest of the experience.\n\n---\n\n## Spacing tools\n\n### Polaris space units\n\nAll measurements used across the experience (space, width, height, etc) must reference Polaris space units to guarantee visual consistency and balance.\n\n<div class="punit-img">\n  <img src="/images/spacing-polaris-units@2x.png" alt="A visual example of a polaris unit">\n</div>\n\n### Space scale\n\n| Value        | Space         | px value | rem value |\n| ------------ | ------------- | -------- | --------- |\n| 0            | --p-space-0   | 0        | 0         |\n| 0.25         | --p-space-025 | 1        | 0.0625    |\n| 0.5          | --p-space-05  | 2        | 0.125     |\n| **1 (base)** | --p-space-1   | 4        | 0.25      |\n| 2            | --p-space-2   | 8        | 0.5       |\n| 3            | --p-space-3   | 12       | 0.75      |\n| 4            | --p-space-4   | 16       | 1         |\n| 5            | --p-space-5   | 20       | 1.25      |\n| 6            | --p-space-6   | 24       | 1.5       |\n| 8            | --p-space-8   | 32       | 2         |\n| 10           | --p-space-10  | 40       | 2.5       |\n| 12           | --p-space-12  | 48       | 3         |\n| 16           | --p-space-16  | 64       | 4         |\n| 20           | --p-space-20  | 80       | 5         |\n| 24           | --p-space-24  | 96       | 6         |\n| 28           | --p-space-28  | 112      | 7         |\n| 32           | --p-space-32  | 128      | 8         |\n\nPolaris units are more dense at a small scale, and less so as dimensions increase.\nThis is intentional to provide a good range to work with, but you must be deliberate in the units you decide to pair. We encourage designing with rhythm and contrast to achieve clear visual hierarchy. This often means skipping at least one unit in the scale when you’re pairing different spaces.\n\n![Examples of different variations of spacing](/images/spacing-scale-examples@2x.png)\n\nRepeating the same amount of spacing (left) and using more variation (right).\n\n<br/>\n\n### Column grid\n\nThe column grid is meant to give teams agency for page layouts, while still providing low level constraints that ensure consistent pages across the experience. This means teams should feel empowered to experiment with layout, as long as they use the column grid as a grounding element.\n\n<video width="100%" height="auto" controls autoplay muted loop>\n  <source src="/images/column.mp4" type="video/mp4">\n</video>\n\n<br/>\n\n### Breakpoints\n\n<video width="100%" height="auto" controls autoplay muted loop>\n  <source src="/images/breakpoints.mp4" type="video/mp4">\n</video>\n\nThe grid adapts to the viewport width. The amount of columns will change depending on how much space there is. This is a recommendation for how much should be displayed horizontally. Less columns means less content.\n\n<br/>\n\n| Screen size                              | Columns | Margin | Gutter | Navigation |\n| ---------------------------------------- | ------- | ------ | ------ | ---------- |\n| **XS** <br/> 0-489 <br/> Phones          | 6       | 16     | 16     | Collapsed  |\n| **SM** <br/> 490-767 <br/> Small tablets | 6       | 16     | 16     | Collapsed  |\n| **MD** <br/> 768-1039 <br/> Tablets      | 6       | 24     | 16     | Visible    |\n| **LG** <br/> 1040-1399 <br/> Laptops     | 12      | 24     | 16     | Visible    |\n| **XL** <br/> 1440+ <br/> Desktops        | 12      | 32     | 16     | Visible    |\n\nThe grid is meant to serve as a point of reference for page level design and alignment, but this doesn’t need to apply to component level layouts.\n\n---\n\n## Essentials for designing with space\n\n### Gestalt principles\n\nThe perception of any given page goes beyond the individual elements presented, and the space between them. People’s perception is heavily influenced by their own expectations and motivations.\nWhen designing, it’s key to consider that people look for patterns, and will always perceive things in their simplest form. For instance, a bunch of similar items stacked on top of each other will likely read as a list.\n\n![Different types of list items, such as menus, popovers, and dropdowns](/images/spacing-principles@2x.png)\n\n<br/>\n\nPeople look for patterns instinctively, and they lean of visual cues like:\n\n#### Similarity\n\nGrouping things based on physical appearance (shape, color, size, orientation).\n\n![Index table](/images/spacing-similarity@2x.png)\n\n<br/>\n\n#### Proximity\n\nGrouping things based on distance between objects.\n\n![Customers and orders page](/images/spacing-proximity@2x.png)\n\n<br/>\n\n#### Continuity\n\nGrouping things based on the way they are arranged.\n\n![Tag multiselect popover and media card](/images/spacing-continuity@2x.png)\n\nShadows inside popovers act as visual cues to indicate additional content when scrolled (left). Cards placed horizontally in a media carousel communicates related topics (right).\n\n<br/>\n\n#### Closure\n\nGrouping things that are implicitly enclosed by a larger object.\n\n![Order details page](/images/spacing-closure@2x.png)\n\n<br/>\n\n#### Common fate\n\nGrouping things based on how they move.\n\n<video width="100%" height="auto" controls autoplay muted loop>\n  <source src="/images/common-fate.mp4" type="video/mp4">\n</video>\n\n<br/>\n\n#### Common Region\n\nGrouping things that are explicitly enclosed by a larger object.\n\n![Customer details card](/images/spacing-common-region@2x.png)\n\nBecause people perceive these instinctively, we can use them as tools to create hierarchy, visual rhythm, and guide the user\'s eye to what’s important.\n\n---\n\n<br/>\n\n### Rhythm\n\nAlternating between objects and space creates a pattern. Repeated patterns create visual rhythm, which can be used to effectively direct the viewer’s attention.\nAnything can establish rhythm: space, typography, icons, color, shape, and size.\n\nLike in music, different types of rhythm serve a different purpose, in design there’s three worth highlighting:\n\n<br/>\n\n![Example of data table](/images/spacing-regular-rhythm@2x.png)\n\n**Regular rhythm** is predictable, which makes it a useful way to organize large sets of objects that have the same level of importance.\n\n<br/>\n\n![Location profile page](/images/spacing-flowing-rhythm@2x.png)\n\n**Flowing rhythm** is organic, and it can bring a high level of scannability to something that would be otherwise a random collection of objects.\n\n<br/>\n\n![Home page with progressive disclosure card](/images/spacing-progressive-rhythm@2x.png)\n\n**Progressive rhythm** is a gradual progression, and is very effective in giving the eye a path to follow, along the progression. This is great to establish hierarchy and aid the user through a series of steps.\n\nRhythm plays another job in designs, it’s the norm that enables the introduction of variation and points of attention, otherwise known as contrast.\n\n---\n\n<br/>\n\n### Density\n\nThe overall perception people get from the space between information as a whole is density. It can range from tight to loose, and there is a very different purpose for each end of the spectrum.\n\n![Examples showign tigher versus looser spacing](/images/spacing-density@2x.png)\n\nTighter spacing (left) makes it easier to scan and comprehend large sets of data, like lists and tables. It also naturally enables one to fit more elements in a given page.\nLooser space (right) can help attract the user attention and make a layout feel more user-friendly.\n\n---\n\n<br/>\n\n### Contrast\n\nContrast is meant to create sticking points that help make content easy to scan, highlight important pieces of information, or just to give viewers a moment to breathe.\n\n![Marketing page and empty state](/images/spacing-contrast@2x.png)\n\n**Highlights (left)**: Callout cards are used to encourage merchants to take an action related to a new feature or opportunity.\n\n**Breather moment (right)**: Empty states provide explanation or guidance to help merchants progress.\n\nContrast can play a role at very different levels, but it must be used sparingly, otherwise its effect gets diluted.\n\n![Examples on the analytics page to show contrast](/images/spacing-analytics@2x.png)\n\nHome feed overview (left) and location profile analytics (right).\n\n---\n\n<br/>\n\n### Optical adjustment\n\nSometimes software will say two objects are aligned, or that they have the same size, but visually they don’t feel like that. This happens because computers aren’t great at perceiving visual weight or simultaneous color contrast, so we can’t fully rely on them to create balanced compositions.\n\nThat means designers must make optical corrections, using Polaris units until the space feels balanced. Some things to keep an eye out for:\n\n<br/>\n\n#### Visual weight ≠ Size\n\nTwo things can have the same size, but feel unbalanced.\n\n![Before and after comparison of optical adjustment applied to a button](/images/spacing-weight-buttons@2x.png)\n\nWithout optical adjustment, the disclosure icon appears too far from the right edge of the button. After optical correction, the perceived spacing is more balanced.\n\n![Before and after comparison of optical adjustment applied to an icon](/images/spacing-weight-icon@2x.png)\n\nThe square icon seems larger compared to the circle icon without optical adjustment, however, they in fact have the same size and diameter. The shapes look visually closer to each other after decreasing the size of the square.\n\n<br/>\n\n#### Colors affect each other\n\nTwo things can have the same colour, but feel unbalanced.\n\n![Before and after comparison of applying the same colour versus slightly different colours to a banner component](/images/spacing-colour@2x.png)',

          '![An illustration of letters constructed from lego blocks](/images/text-featured@2x.png)\n\n## Working with typography\n\n![A series of three illustrations representing the principles make it readable, make it adaptable, reinforce the message](/images/text-principles@2x.png)\n\n### 1. Make it scannable\n\nKeep related text aligned and closer together to create visual groupings. For most languages, the the majority of text should be left-aligned.\n\n### 2. Adjust text based on device size and distance from the merchant\n\nBecause small screens are often at an arm\'s distance, we can decrease the size of larger headings and increase the size of important body text.\n\n### 3. Create visual hierarchy\n\nPair font weight, size, and color together to create hierarchy. Use a lighter color or font-size to de-emphasize secondary content.\n\n---\n\n## Essentials for designing with type\n\nWhen designing with type, we can use a combination of font size, weight, color, and space to ensure a strong hierarchy and scannability of a page. By understanding the fundamentals, you’ll be able to better apply type to the UI.\n\n### Using the bounding box\n\nThe bounding box is the vertical height of the text and is defined by the text’s line-height. The value of the line-height is critical to make sure text aligns to the 4px grid. Refer to individual type styles for specified heights.\n\n![An image showing how the bounding box applies to text elements](/images/text-bounding-box@2x.png)\n\n### Using the baseline\n\nThe baseline is the imaginary line that letters rest on. Align text horizontally to the baseline for a simple clean look.\n\n![An image showing the baseline and how it applies to text elements](/images/text-align-baseline@2x.png)\n\nThere are situations where it makes sense to have multiple text sizes on a single line to establish hierarchy of elements. Aligning to the text’s baseline instead of center gives a more harmonious look.\n\n![An example of aligning text elements to the baseline](/images/text-center-baseline@2x.png)\n\n### Line length\n\nLine length describes the width of the content. For longer body text, the recommended line length is between 40 to 60 characters.\n\n![A diagram showing the ideal line length for text](/images/text-line-length@2x.png)\n\n### Color\n\nColor can be used to add contrast and reinforce the hierarchy between text.\n\nFor example, one way to distinguish between a title and a subtitle is to apply `--p-text-color` to the title, and `--p-text-subdued` to the subtitle. Using a lighter color for secondary information provides contrast between the text and helps reinforce hierarchy even when the text is the same size and weight.\n\n![An image showing how you can use color to add hierarchy within text elements](/images/text-color-different@2x.png)\n\n### Space\n\nWe can help merchants navigate the UI by grouping related information together. One way to do this is to use space to create relationships between elements on a page.\n\nAmbiguous spacing can cause confusion and make it hard to understand the content.\n\n![An image of showing how to use space to create hierachy and relationships between text elements](/images/text-spacing-adjustments@2x.png)\n\n---\n\n## Font sizes\n\nAll font sizes have a ratio of 1.2, known as the major third type scale. This means that each size is multiplied or divided by 1.2 from the previous size, starting with the base size, and rounded to a multiple of 4px.\n\n| Token             | px value | rem value |\n| ----------------- | -------- | --------- |\n| `p-font-size-700` | 40       | 2.5       |\n| `p-font-size-600` | 32       | 2         |\n| `p-font-size-500` | 28       | 1.75      |\n| `p-font-size-400` | 24       | 1.5       |\n| `p-font-size-300` | 20       | 1.25      |\n| `p-font-size-200` | 16       | 1         |\n| `p-font-size-100` | 14       | 0.875     |\n| `p-font-size-75`  | 12       | 0.75      |\n\n---\n\n## Type styles\n\nPolaris type styles are grouped into two categories: heading and body. Each has a default set of variants along with a set of options to allow for flexibility and a wide range of applications within the user interface. They use one scale, so they can be applied to any screen size.\n\n### Body styles\n\nBody styles are used within components and blocks of text.\n\n![An image showing how body styles are applied](/images/text-body-example-01@2x.png)\n\n### Heading styles\n\nHeading styles are used to create various levels of hierarchy on the page. These styles range in size and weight. Using a blend of the two can help distinguish content and guide merchants through the page.\n\n`headingXl` - `heading4xl` styles are typically used for numerals and key moments in the merchant’s journey. As the largest text on the screen, use these styles sparingly within a single page. These styles should draw the merchant’s attention to important key pieces of information.\n\n![An image showing how heading styles are applied](/images/text-heading-example-01@2x.png)\n\n`headingXs` - `headingLg` styles are most commonly used for card, section, or page titles.\n\n![An image showing how large heading styles are applied](/images/text-heading-example-02@2x.png)\n\n### Responsive styles\n\nLarge heading styles, `headingLg` - `heading4xl`, are responsive and will change size at different breakpoints.\n\nSmall heading styles, `headingXs` - `headingMd`, and body styles will remain the same size regardless of breakpoint unless specified. You can choose to adjust the size of these styles at specific breakpoints when needed. For instance, you may need to increase the size of important body text on smaller screens.\n\n<video width="100%" height="auto" controls autoplay muted loop>\n  <source src="/images/text-responsive.mp4" type="video/mp4">\n</video>\n\n![An image showing how heading styles change based on breakpoint](/images/type-responsive-styles@2x.png)\n\n### Uppercase styles\n\nThe design language no longer supports uppercase typography. We recommend using the [Text component](/components/typography/text) to apply visual hierarchy. Work with your team to determine a type style that works best for your use case.\n\n---\n\n## Font stack\n\nWe use a font stack that adapts to the operating system it runs on, like macOS, iOS, Windows, Android or Linux distributions.\n\n![A diagram showing a selection of default iOS, Mac, Windows, Android and Linux fonts](/images/type-fontstack@2x.png)\n\n- Apple devices will display [San Francisco](https://developer.apple.com/fonts/)\n- Android devices will display\n  [Roboto](https://material.io/guidelines/resources/roboto-noto-fonts.html)\n- Devices running Windows will display\n  [Segoe UI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segoe#Segoe_UI)\n- Machines running Linux will display the default sans-serif font for any running distribution\n\nThis font-stack makes sure all browsers can load platform-specific fonts:\n\n```\n-apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, San Francisco, Segoe UI, Roboto, Helvetica Neue, sans-serif\n```\n\nAdd this to your CSS to preload system fonts and set up browsers for legibility:\n\n```css\nhtml {\n  /* Load system fonts */\n  font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, San Francisco, Segoe UI,\n    Roboto, Helvetica Neue, sans-serif;\n\n  /* Make type rendering look crisper */\n  -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased;\n  -moz-osx-font-smoothing: grayscale;\n\n  /* Deactivate auto-enlargement of small text in Safari */\n  text-size-adjust: 100%;\n\n  /* Enable kerning and optional ligatures */\n  text-rendering: optimizeLegibility;\n}\n\n/**\n * Form elements render using OS defaults,\n * so font-family inheritance must be specifically declared\n */\nbutton,\ninput,\noptgroup,\nselect,\ntextarea {\n  font-family: inherit;\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Mobile considerations\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- Refer to the platform’s native font scales when designing experiences for native apps\n- Refer to the small-screen scale when designing experiences for mobile browsers\n- Use the platform-specific component library\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- Use the native font scale\n- Keep in mind that all UI elements containing text will be affected\n- Explore additional content height, width, truncation, and line wraps\n\n</div></div>',

          'This includes:\n\n- A beautiful and functional design\n- Consistent and useful [copy](/content/product-content)\n- Principles of\n  [universal design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_design) and inclusivity\n\n---\n\n## Usable for everyone\n\nIt’s important that Shopify products—and [Partner](https://www.shopify.ca/partners) products—are usable and useful to everyone.\n\nEveryone is a pretty big group. It includes our merchants, their customers, our developer partners, our employees, and the greater tech community at large. That also includes all members of our community who have disabilities.\n\nDisabilities may affect how people move, see, hear, communicate, learn, understand, and process information.\nAs a result, it’s important to consider how to design and develop your product to support a wide range of needs and experiences.\n\nIn the United States, as many as 1 in 4 adults has at least 1 disability [Source: [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2018/p0816-disability.html)]. In Canada, the estimate is 22%, and elsewhere in the world the estimate is closer to 1 in 7 [Source: [Statistics Canada](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/11-627-m/11-627-m2018035-eng.htm), [World Bank](https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/disability)].\n\n---\n\n## Building inclusive experiences\n\nUsing our [components](/components) is a way to improve accessibility and consistency when building products for Shopify.\n\n- The component library in this style guide includes code we can use across applications\n- This component code includes accessible markup\n- Since the code exists in a single component that gets reused, it’s easier to update and fix any bugs\n\nThe build-it-once, use-it-everywhere model means the accessibility knowledge of the designers and developers who build these components is available to all of Shopify and our partners. Because of this, merchants get a consistent experience that can be leveraged into accessible products.\n\nMany accessibility features come free in the components. But, it’s important to make sure that components are integrated in a way that doesn\'t create unforeseen accessibility barriers. Depending how components are used, there may be more design and implementation considerations. Be sure to test user task flows post integration.\n\n### Managing focus to support merchant workflows\n\nDon’t programmatically move focus to new content without merchant input. Polaris components that use controls to display overlays, such as modals and popovers, manage focus automatically.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- When a merchant activates a link that goes elsewhere in the page, move focus to that content\n- When a merchant must access an overlay, move focus to it\n- When a merchant submits a form that results in an error, move focus to the error message\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- Move focus when content updates in the background\n- Move focus when the user is actively working elsewhere on the page\n\n</div></div>\n\nThe only case where focus should be managed without the merchant’s okay is when the merchant needs to be interrupted because they cannot continue their current workflow.\n\n### Limiting non-standard interactions\n\nMerchants will expect to interact with controls and content in ways that follow the defaults for their browser, platform, and assistive technologies. Introducing non-standard features can give merchants better ways of accomplishing tasks, but they can also create barriers.\n\nFor example, merchants who rely on the keyboard will expect that buttons can be activated with the <kbd>enter</kbd>/<kbd>return</kbd> key or the <kbd>space</kbd> key. If buttons are programmed to be used with different keys, merchants will need to be instructed on how to use them.\n\nBefore designing or building custom features that use non-standard controls or interactions, first consider whether the goal can be met using native features.\n\nIf non-standard interactions _are_ required:\n\n- Carefully follow guidelines and best practices for designing, building, and testing custom features on your platform\n- Give merchants clear instructions for using the custom feature\n- Provide an additional, standard way to accomplish the task\n\n### Assistive technology support\n\nOur components are tested for accessibility with automated and manual techniques. Merchants should expect to be able to access features built with our components using modern assistive technologies. These include native and third-party tools like:\n\n- Screen readers\n- Speech recognition programs\n- Supports for low vision and color blindness\n- Alternative keyboards\n- Switch devices\n- Tools for readability\n\n### Coding standards\n\nPolaris components start with web standards for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Features from the Accessible Rich Internet Applications (WAI-ARIA or ARIA) specification are used to build functionality that is not available in native HTML.\n\n### Alternative text\n\nTo help people who rely on assistive technologies, such as a screen reader or other text to speech programs, our components use [alternative text](/content/alternative-text) for icons and images used to convey information and actions (like buttons and links).\n\n### Meeting the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)\n\nPolaris targets WCAG 2.1 Level A and Level AA success criteria, and seeks to provide a highly usable experience for everyone.\n\nFor more information, see the following resources:\n\n- [WCAG 2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/)\n- [ARIA 1.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/)\n- [Shopify\'s statement of commitment to accessibility](https://www.shopify.com/accessibility)\n\n### Feedback\n\nSometimes, building accessible and inclusive experiences can be difficult.

          'These values are at the heart of how we build experiences at Shopify. They’re important whether you work at Shopify or you’re developing third-party apps or themes.\n\n---\n\n## Our approach\n\nThe best part of this shared set of values is the conversations they enable. They are fantastic lenses through which to view, critique, and improve our work.\n\nWe always aspire for Shopify experiences to feel:\n\n### Considerate\n\nAbove all else, we show care for the people who use our tools and products. We’re here to make their day-to-day and long-term work better — no matter who they are, where they are, or what platform they’re using.\n\n- Build experiences that work on every screen, on every platform, in every language, and in every country.\n- Take time to understand where we can build for a general audience, and where we should offer different paths for different needs.\n- Respect the reality of this work – don’t assume the perfect situation, preparation, or usage.\n\n### Empowering\n\nWe want people to feel like they can accomplish whatever they’re trying to do. Our experiences should give people confidence that they’re capable of achieving their goals, no matter their level of experience.\n\n- Help users complete their tasks, without taking away decisions or independence.\n- Optimize for the most important tasks without blocking people from doing the rest.\n- Hide complexity where you can, but give people access to more sophistication if they need it.\n\n### Crafted\n\nShopify experiences should feel like they were created with the highest level of craftsmanship. Through thoughtful details and small touches, we combine the power of professional tools with the simplicity of consumer products.\n\n- Work to understand the complex problems users face, then find clear and approachable solutions to those problems.\n- Delight people with how powerful and effective an experience is, not with extra decoration or flair.\n- Look for meaningful ways to make experiences more natural, friendly, and thoughtful.\n\n### Efficient\n\nShopify experiences should help people achieve their goals quickly, accurately, and with less effort. We value speed and simplicity, but we value productivity even more.\n\n- Break complex tasks down into simple steps, and remove repetitive tasks whenever you can.\n- Use friction to highlight important decisions, then let users get back to work.\n- Give users the ability to reduce and optimize their workloads through automation and bulk actions.\n\n### Trustworthy\n\nWe constantly work to earn trust with our users. We pay attention to detail. We’re genuine and transparent because it shows we’re acting in users’ best interests.\n\n- Fix small mistakes and inconsistencies that erode trust.\n- Be transparent about what features and tools can or can’t do.\n- Make safe and positive actions frictionless. If they’re risky, give clear instructions and greater control. Make it easy to recover from mistakes.\n\n### Familiar\n\nWe want people to feel comfortable using our products, whether it’s their first time using them or their hundredth. Our experiences should embody the same principles, act the same way, and fit together seamlessly.\n\n- Think bigger than any individual task or product. Understand the context users are working in.\n- Use familiar patterns to make experiences intuitive and recognizable.\n- Evolve experiences seamlessly. They should keep getting better with time and information.',

          'There’s a currency formatting framework to:\n\n- Help more merchants sell globally\n- Localize currency formatting for merchants and customers everywhere\n- Unify the display of mixed currencies to help merchants manage multiple currency stores\n- Implement the formatting through APIs\n\n---\n\n## Definitions\n\nA store can have more than one type of currency and currency format.\n\n### Store currency\n\nThe main currency of the store and the Shopify default. All sales and reports are shown in the store currency.\n\n### Non-store currency\n\nAny other type of currency is called “non-store currency”. Types of non-store currency include:\n\n- Presentment currency: The type of currency that is presented to buyers in a merchant’s store. For multi-currency stores, it can be different from store currency.\n- Payout currency: The type of currency used to pay merchants for their sales. For multi-currency stores, it can be different from store currency.\n- Billing currency: The type of currency used to bill merchants for themes, app purchases, and monthly subscriptions. Billing currency is in USD only, but might include local currencies for tax purposes.\n\n### Short format\n\nIncludes the currency symbol and currency value. This format is used for currency that merchants are familiar with.\n\nExamples: \\$12.50; 12,50 €\n\n### Explicit format\n\nIncludes the currency symbol, currency value, and ISO code (for example, “USD” and “CAD”). Best used for currency that merchants aren’t familiar with and don’t expect to see.\n\nExamples: \\$12.50 CAD; 12,50 € EUR\n\n---\n\n## Aligning with global standards\n\nShopify uses [Common Locale Database Repository (CLDR)](http://cldr.unicode.org/) for localization formatting for currency, date, time, and amount.\n\n- It’s the recognized international standard\n- It automatically formats numbers and currency based on the merchant’s locale\n- The repository is maintained by a third party\n\nCLDR determines:\n\n- Whether the currency symbol appears before or after the amount (for example, $250, 250 USD, 250 $)\n- Whether decimals are used (for example, there are no “cents” in Japanese yen)\n- Whether the decimal sign is a period or a comma (for example, 37,50 or 37.50)\n- How to group numbers (for example, 10,000 or 1,0000, or using spaces)\n\nCLDR doesn’t determine the appropriate level of detail shown in different contexts. For example, it can’t determine when to show the currency symbol and value ([short format](#short-format)), or the currency symbol, value, and ISO code ([explicit format](#explicit-format)).\n\nThough short format is more efficient, it’s important to provide clarity for merchants who deal with unfamiliar currencies in multi-currency stores. In those cases, use explicit format.\n\n---\n\n## Design guidelines\n\nBecause CLDR formatting is limited, these guidelines will help you choose the appropriate level of currency detail to display in a multi-currency context.\n\n### Merchants\n\n#### Store currency\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\nDefault to [short format](#short-format).\n\n![Short format in today’s sales card](/images/do-use-short-format@2x.png)\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\nUse [explicit format](#explicit-format) except when presenting store currency within in a mixed-currency context.\n\n![Incorrect explicit format in today’s sales card](/images/dont-use-explicit-format@2x.png)\n\n</div></div>\n\n#### Non-store currency\n\n- Use explicit format when showing total amounts, an amount within a button, or in a paragraph\n- Use short format when showing non-total amounts with total amounts\n\n![](/images/paid-status-explicit@2x.png)\n\nThis example shows a scenario where the presentment currency is in USD, which is different than the store currency. The non-total amounts in the paid status card are in short format, and the total amounts are in explicit format.\n\n![](/images/refund-non-store-currency@2x.png)\n\nThis example shows a scenario refunding an order that’s in a non-store currency.\n\n![](/images/short-format-non-total@2x.png)\n\nThis example illustrates the use of short format for non-total amounts and explicit format for total amounts in a data table.\n\n#### Negative amount display\n\nAlways place the negative symbol before the currency and amount in either format.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n- \\-\\$4.20\n- -12,50 €\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n- \\$-4.20\n- 12,50 €-\n\n</div></div>\n\n### Customers\n\n- Default to explicit format whenever prices are customer-facing. Use short format for unit prices, itemized prices, and installment prices.\n- If there are enough indicators to let customers know which currency they’re looking at, short format may be sufficient. When using short format, make sure to always use explicit format for cart total, checkout total, and notification totals.\n\n![](/images/short-format-installment-prices@2x.png)\n\nThis example shows the use of short format for installment prices.\n\n![](/images/short-format-unit-prices@2x.png)\n\nThis example shows the use of short format for unit prices.\n\n![](/images/short-format-itemized-prices@2x.png)\n\nThis example shows the use of short format for itemized prices.\n\n---\n\n## Guiding questions when making design decisions\n\nUse the following questions to guide you when making decisions about currency formatting.\n\n**Does the merchant know which currency they’re looking at?**\n\n- Which currency do they expect to see?\n- Do they know which currency their orders are in if they have a multi-currency store?\n\n**Does the currency format support the merchant’s main task?**\n\n- Is the main task scanning, comparing and analyzing, or taking an action (for example, a refund)?\n\n**Are there enough details to make an informed decision?**\n\n- For example, do they know the currency of their non-store currency order refund?\n- Can they distinguish between the sales report and payout summary if the store currency and payout currency are different?\n\n**Can the UI be simplified without creating confusion?**\n\nWe don’t want to show [explicit format](#explicit-format) everywhere and for every task.\n\n- How can we make currency formatting both simple and accurate?\n\n---\n\n## Design tips\n\nMock up a scenario where the store, presentment, payout, and billing currencies are different. This scenario is becoming more common as more merchants start selling globally.\n\n### Use currencies that share the same symbol to test for clarity\n\nUSD, CAD, AUD, HKD, SGD are just a few of the many currencies that share the same symbol “\\$”.\n\n### Use Japanese Yen (JPY) amount to test currency length and space constraints\n\n1 USD is approximately 100 JPY. If there is enough space for the JPY amount, it should work for most other major currencies.\n\n### When in doubt, let the guiding questions help you make a decision\n\nThe guiding questions are meant to help make merchant-focused decisions about which format to use when the use case is unclear.\n\n---\n\n## Major currencies in their local formats\n\nThis table shows commonly-used currencies in short and explicit formats.\n\n| Currency                        | Locale       | Short format | Explicit format |\n| ------------------------------- | ------------ | ------------ | --------------- |\n| **US Dollar ($, USD)**          | en-US        | $12.50       | $12.50 USD      |\n| **Canadian Dollar ($, CAD)**    | en-CA        | $12.50       | $12.50 CAD      |\n|                                 | fr-CA        | 12,50 $      | 12,50 $ CAD     |\n| **Australian Dollar ($, AUD)**  | en-AU        | $12.50       | $12.50 AUD      |\n| **Euro (€, EUR)**               | de-DE, fr-FR | 12,50 €      | 12,50 € EUR     |\n|                                 | en-IE        | €12.50       | €12.50 EUR      |\n|                                 | nl-NL        | €12,50       | €12,50 EUR      |\n| **British Pounds (£, GBP)**     | en-GB        | £12.50       | £12.50 GBP      |\n| **Japanese Yen (¥, JPY)**       | ja-JP        | ¥1250        | ¥1250 JPY       |\n| **New Zealand Dollar ($, NZD)** | en-NZ        | $12.50       | $12.50 NZD      |\n| **Hong Kong Dollar ($, HKD)**   | zh-HK        | $12.50       | $12.50 HKD      |\n| **Singapore Dollar ($, SGD)**   | zh-SG        | $12.50       | $12.50 SGD      |\n| **Danish Krone (Kr, DKK)**      | da-DK        | 12,50 kr.    | 12,50 kr. DKK   |\n\n---\n\n## Implementation\n\nTo format currency in a React component, use the [`Shopify/react-i18n`](https://github.com/Shopify/quilt/tree/master/packages/react-i18n) library’s `formatCurrency` method. You can select either `short` or `explicit` formatting by setting the `form` option as shown in the code example below.\n\n```jsx\nimport {useI18n} from \'@shopify/react-i18n\';\n\nconst [i18n] = useI18n();\n\ni18n.locale = \'de-AT\';\n\nconst eurDeAt = i18n.formatCurrency(price, {\n  currency: \'EUR\',\n  form: \'short\',\n});\n\nconst eurDeAtExp = i18n.formatCurrency(price, {\n  currency: \'EUR\',\n  form: \'explicit\',\n});\n```',

          '## Defining IA\n\nInformation architecture is the practice of organizing, structuring, and labeling content in an effective and sustainable way. Whether you’re creating an app, part of the Shopify admin, a new feature, or an editorial page, these IA principles are here to help you make content usable and findable.\n\n---\n\n## Why we do IA\n\n1. Simplify complexity: Information should be structured and managed in the simplest way possible.\n2. Support scalability: Good IA practices will help us avoid overhauling our previous work whenever the product grows or changes.\n3. Create familiarity: Regardless of how our merchants access Shopify, it should feel like the same product. Creating a common experience goes beyond design and extends to how we structure Shopify’s content.\n\n---\n\n## Our IA principles\n\nThese principles will help you make good IA decisions no matter what you’re working on.\n\n### Show your audience where they are\n\nSuccessful wayfinding happens when your audience can make navigation decisions that fulfill their goal. For navigation to enable wayfinding:\n\n- Establish multiple navigation schemes\n- Use task-based navigation\n- Integrate secondary navigational support (like breadcrumbs)\n\nNavigation is a tool that serves a number of wayfinding purposes.\nGood navigation allows our merchants to explore a topic in depth, switch tasks easily, and filter information.\n\nIn the Shopify admin, merchants can find their way using multiple navigation schemes:\n\n- Structural: main navigation, local navigation, breadcrumbs\n- Associative: contextual links to other features or help documentation\n- Utility: linked avatars to access your account, search\n\nIn the Shopify admin, merchants can find their way to the blog posts page using the side navigation (nav) and search. They can use the breadcrumb to go up to the main level in the Online Store section of the nav. They can also access related help documentation through the contextual “learn more” footer at the bottom of the page.\n\n![Blog posts page breadcrumbs and left side navigation](/images/blogposts-breadcrumb-nav@2x.png)\n\n### Give content one home and many doors\n\nAll people are unique and have different information-seeking behaviors. For example, one person might start their experience from various points in a product or shift their focus midway through a task. They might also begin a task on one device and finish it on another. To facilitate these behaviors, all screens should have meaningful navigation and bridge content to other parts of the product.\n\nThe content on the Shopify Help Center’s shipping page only lives in the Help Center—we don’t duplicate it in the Shopify admin or on our marketing pages. But even though it only lives in one place, we give merchants access to it when it’s likely that they’ll need more context on shipping (like through a link on our shipping settings page in the Shopify admin).\n\n![shipping labels settings with link to docs](/images/shippinglabels-link@2x.png)\n\n### Avoid information overload\n\nAlthough we want to give our merchants all the information they need to complete a task, we need to avoid overloading them with information. Don’t over-simplify, but don’t burden your user with choice. To do this in design, we use progressive disclosure, but this principle also applies to information architecture. To practice progressive disclosure in IA:\n\n- Gradually reveal information as it’s requested\n- Provide multiple access points to information\n- Eliminate redundant content\n\nThe content on the [Shopify Capital page](https://www.shopify.com/capital) on Shopify.com summarizes the benefits of receiving capital from Shopify at a high level. After scanning the summary, merchants have the option to access more information about the program with a link to the [docs on the Shopify Help Center](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/your-account/shopify-capital?itcat=capital&itterm=capital-resources-help-docs). By progressively disclosing information in this way, we help merchants reach decisions faster and avoid the frustration and disorientation of front-loading with too much detail.\n\n![capital page landing page](/images/capitalpage-hero@2x.jpg)\n\n### Plan for growth and change\n\nInformation architecture, like design, is not set in stone. It should change with your product. As such, the IA decisions you make need to leave room for growth while also continuing to promote consistency across the experience.\n\nThe [Shopify.com homepage](https://www.shopify.com/) takes a scalable approach to page architecture—the structure was designed to adapt as Shopify expands to different locations. This was done by taking a modular approach.\n\nEach locale can customize the homepage to meet their needs. For example, for 2 stories, they can use 2 banners. For 3, they can use 1 banner and 2 tiles.\n\n![Three content components Denmark page](/images/de-component@2x.png)\n\n![2 content components India page](/images/india-component@2x.jpg)\n\nTo make sure your IA decisions are scalable:\n\n- Communicate early and often, within and outside of your team.\n  Open the lines of communication when doing IA work and make sure your work aligns with the work of other areas of the product.\n- Think about the future and how the work you’re doing will intersect with other projects.\n- Create content groups that are flexible enough to accommodate growth, while being meaningful to the user.\n- Consider how your IA will adapt to multiple environments and their existing patterns (for instance, iOS, Android, desktop browsers, chat bots, retail products like Point of Sale).',

However, when a certain experience doesn’t fit a specific market, we should tailor it.\n\n---\n\n## Definitions\n\n### Internationalization\n\nBuilding your product and interface so they can be used in different locales. This includes creating flexible interfaces that allow for text expansion and changes to word order.\n\n### Localization\n\nAdapting your product and interface for different locales to make them a good cultural fit. This includes adapting features, changing visuals, and translating text.\n\n### Translation\n\nConverting text from one language to another. Not to be confused with localization, translation is just one part of localizing a product.\n\n### Locale\n\nA linguistic region defined by both its language and country. Examples:\nFrench-France (fr-FR); French-Canada (fr-CA); Portuguese-Brazil (pt-BR). Note that languages and countries won’t always have a 1:1 mapping.\n\n---\n\n## Plan for text expansion\n\nWhen interfaces are localized, the content will often expand in length. In most languages, text is up to 50% longer on average than English. Some non-Latin languages, such as Japanese, take up more vertical space. For character-based languages, text wrapping and line breaking can’t always rely on spaces to separate words. Your interface needs to be flexible enough to accommodate language-specific formatting and text expansion without changing its context of use.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n![Good example of flexible layouts with text expansion](/images/info-hierarchy-do@2x.png)\n\nLay out your elements in a way where text expansion doesn’t hinder your information hierarchy.\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n![Bad example of flexible layouts with text expansion](/images/info-hierarchy-dont@2x.png)\n\nDon’t rely on responsive stacking alone. It can often change the hierarchy of information of the layout. In this case, the text expansion causes the line break at the wrong spot, placing the button in the middle of the heading and content of this card.\n\n</div></div>\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n![Good example of narrow columns with text expansion](/images/narrow-columns-do@2x.png)\n\nUse single columns to stack elements flexibly to accomodate for text expansion.\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n![Bad example of narrow columns with text expansion](/images/narrow-columns-dont@2x.png)\n\nAvoid using narrow columns in smaller components. Ensure the right amount of padding for a clean interface.\n\n</div></div>\n\n### Tips\n\n- Always assume the worst-case scenario for text length, especially on mobile and in layouts such as tables and columns. Avoid using narrow columns.\n- Pay particular attention to content elements that only have a few words. In English, labels and buttons [exclude words such as “a” or “the”](/content/actionable-language#buttons), but many other languages need to include them. Overall these small pieces of text may expand up to 300%.\n- Our components are designed to be expandable, but you should still test them in your designs and builds. Check the CSS layout to make sure text doesn’t overflow when the screen size is reduced.\n- Work with linguistic experts to review line breaks and word wrapping for character-based languages, like Chinese or Japanese, to ensure they don’t break sentences.\n\n---\n\n## Plan for changes in word order\n\nWord order can change dramatically in translation. If the layout and functionality of your interface is dependent on a certain word order, it’s likely to break when localized.\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n![Good example of avoiding sentence-based UI](/images/sentence-based-ui-do@2x.png)\n\nIf content elements need to stay in a certain position on the page, implement them as separate labels, outside of sentences.\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n![Bad example of sentence-based UI](/images/sentence-based-ui-dont@2x.png)\n\nDon’t place elements with a fixed position inside a sentence. The order of this sentence would often need to change in translation, which is impossible to do if the interface is built this way.\n\n</div></div>\n\n<div class="dodont"><div class="dodont-part" data-type="do">\n\n#### Do\n\n![Good example of hyperlinking text](/images/hyperlink-text-do@2x.png)\n\nWhen including links in body text, only use a single and descriptive term or a small part of a phrase as the link. Find out more about [links](/content/actionable-language#links).\n\n</div><div class="dodont-part" data-type="dont">\n\n#### Don’t\n\n![Bad example of link within sentence](/images/hyperlink-text-dont@2x.png)\n\nDon’t use full phrases as links. Word order changes might break the link into several parts when translated.\n\n</div></div>\n\n### Tips\n\n- Assume the word order of every sentence in your interface will change when translated.\n- Avoid using UI components to build sentences.\n- Avoid splitting one sentence into several strings, known as concatenated strings. If you use concatenated strings, translators won’t be able to change the word order and their translations won’t make sense.\n- Avoid using variables in your strings as it will translate differently.\n\n---\n\n## Plan for cultural differences\n\nMerchants in each locale have different cultural sensibilities. Use visuals, content, and interface formats that are useful and meaningful to merchants in all parts of the world.\n\n![Good example of icon usage](/images/icons-meaning@2x.png)\n\nWhen possible, use universally known icons. Be mindful of when you use country-specific icons and where they are surfaced. Find out more about [icons](/design/icons).\n\n![Bad example of text fields](/images/colors-cultural-context@2x.png)\n\nBe mindful of using colors to represent meaning. Colors can hold discrete connotations in different cultures. For example, in North America, green is used to indicate success and red for failure, as opposed to China, where red symbolizes prosperity and good fortune.\n\n### Tips\n\n- When using photos, illustrations, icons, or emojis, make sure the visuals you’re using are not offensive or culturally insensitive. If you’re unsure about a visual you’re using, research it or ask someone with local knowledge.\n- When naming features, be mindful of connotations in other cultures, especially for evocative names and acronyms. Find out more about [naming](/content/naming).\n- Avoid colloquial words, idioms, and references to popular culture. It’s difficult to translate them in a meaningful way.\n- In some cultures, a person’s given name comes first, whereas in other cultures the family name comes first. Let merchants choose how they want to enter, read, and sort names, especially in text fields and lists.\n- Many types of information, such as addresses, dates, numbers, and currencies, are shown in different formats in different locales. For example, some locales display currency symbols before the number, others display them after. Make sure these can be translated appropriately. Find out more about [formatting localized currency](/foundations/formatting-localized-currency#navigation).\n- Some cultures expect more guidelines and instructions when filling in long or critical forms. Consider using asterisks to mark mandatory fields in a form to match that expectation.\n- Work with people that have local knowledge if possible.\n\n---\n\n## Internationalize Polaris components\n\n- When designing with a Polaris component, test the localized versions to make sure it still works with the rest of your interface.\n  If you need a certain component to adapt, but it hasn’t yet been internationalized in Polaris, you can open a feature request in [GitHub](https://github.com/Shopify/polaris-react/issues/).',
