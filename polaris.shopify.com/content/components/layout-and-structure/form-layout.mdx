    description: Use to horizontally arrange closely related fields within a larger form or group.

Field groups wrap automatically on smaller screens.
  - fileName: form-layout-nested-groups.tsx
    title: Nested groups
    description: Use to horizontally and vertically arrange closely related fields within a larger form. Works best for grouping familiar fields such as a row of city, state, and zip code fields in an address field group. Field groups wrap automatically on smaller screens.
  - fileName: form-layout-condensed-group.tsx
    title: Condensed group
    description: Use for inline groups of inputs with short character length, like numeric dimensions. Field groups wrap automatically on smaller screens.The mininum width of the fields is reduced in condensed groups to allow more fields to fit in the row before wrapping to an additional row.

# {frontmatter.title}

<Lede>

Use form layout to arrange fields within a form using standard spacing. By default it stacks fields vertically but also supports horizontal groups of fields.

</Lede>

<Examples />

<Props componentName={frontmatter.title} />

## Best practices

Forms should:

- Be considerate of merchants’ time and privacy by only asking for information that’s required
- Group related tasks under section titles to provide more context and make the interface easier to scan
- Follow a logical, predictable order—for example, always ask for first name first, and last name second on forms

## Content guidelines

### Form section title

Form section titles should follow the content guidelines for [headings and subheadings](https://polaris.shopify.com/content/actionable-language#headings-and-subheadings).

### Field label

A label is a short description of a field. Labels are not help text, and they shouldn’t be used to provide instruction, but they should be meaningful and clearly indicate what is expected. Labels should be:

- Placed above or beside the form field
- Short and succinct (1–3 words)
- Written in sentence case (the first word capitalized, the rest lowercase)

<DoDont>

#### Do

- Email address

#### Don’t

- What is your email address?

</DoDont>

<DoDont>

#### Do

- Phone number

#### Don’t

- My phone number is:

</DoDont>

### Help text

Help text provides extra guidance to people filling out a form field. This text is easy for people to ignore, so merchants should not need to depend on it to fill out a form. As with all forms, help text should be succinct and easy to read.
