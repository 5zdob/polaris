examples:
  - fileName: form-layout-default.tsx
    title: Default
    description: Use to arrange fields vertically in a simple form.
  - fileName: form-layout-with-groups.tsx
    title: With groups
    description: Use to arrange related fields within a larger form into sections.
  - fileName: form-layout-with-inline-group.tsx
    title: Inline group
    description: Use to horizontally arrange closely related fields within a larger form or form group. For example, a row of city, state, and zip code fields in a customer profile form. Form groups are inline by default. Do not inline unrelated fields, as this makes them easier to miss. Field groups wrap automatically on smaller screens. Set the `presentational` prop on the form group if it's strictly for layout and shouldn't be marked up as a semantic section of the form.
  - fileName: form-layout-with-vertical-group.tsx
    title: Vertical group
    description: Use to vertically arrange closely related fields within a larger form or form group. Field groups wrap automatically on smaller screens. Set the `presentational` prop on the form group if it's strictly for layout and shouldn't be marked up as a semantic section of the form.
  - fileName: form-layout-with-condensed-group.tsx
    title: Condensed group
    description: Use for inline groups of inputs with short character length, like numeric dimensions. The mininum width of the fields is reduced by 50% in condensed groups to allow more fields to fit in the row before wrapping to an additional row. Field groups wrap automatically on smaller screens. Set the `presentational` prop on the form group if it's strictly for layout and shouldn't be marked up as a semantic section of the form.
  - fileName: form-layout-with-nested-groups.tsx
    title: Nested groups
    description: Use to horizontally and vertically arrange closely related fields within a larger form. Works best for arranging familiar fields  within a larger field group, such as a row of city, state, and zip code fields in an address field group. Field groups wrap automatically on smaller screens. Set the `presentational` prop on the form group if it's strictly for layout and shouldn't be marked up as a semantic section of the form.

# {frontmatter.title}

<Lede>

Use form layout to arrange and group fields within a form using standard spacing.

</Lede>

<Examples />

<Props componentName={frontmatter.title} />

## Best practices

Forms should:

- Be considerate of merchants’ time and privacy by only asking for information that’s required.
- Group related fields in a large form in `FormLayout.Group` with a `title` to make the form easier to read and successfully complete.
- Follow a logical, predictable order. For example, name and address fields should be arranged in the order that is customary for the merchant's locale

## Content guidelines

### Group title

Form group titles should follow the content guidelines for [headings and subheadings](https://polaris.shopify.com/content/actionable-language#headings-and-subheadings).

### Group help text

Form groups can have help text to provide extra guidance to merchants filling out a sectioned form. This text is easy for people to ignore, so merchants should not need to depend on it to fill out a form. As with all help text, form group help text should be succinct, easy to read, and provided only if necessary.

## FormLayout.Group

A `FormLayout.Group` is used to arrange related fields within a larger form into sections within a `FormLayout`. `FormLayout.Group` is given the semantic `role` of `group` by default, but it can be used strictly for layout by setting the `presentational` prop.

### FormLayout.Group properties

| Prop            | Type                    | Description                                                                                                                                                           |
| --------------- | ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| children?       | ReactNode               | The child inputs to group.                                                                                                                                            |
| condensed?      | boolean                 | Whether to reduce the `min-width` of child inputs by 50%. Use when an `inline` group has child inputs with a short maximum character length, like numeric dimensions. |
| presentational? | boolean                 | Use when nesting a group inside of another for layout purposes. Presentational groups will not have a `role` of `group` and cannot be given a title or help text.     |
| title?          | string                  | Label describing the input group.                                                                                                                                     |
| helpText?       | ReactNode               | Helpful text for the input group.                                                                                                                                     |
| variant?        | "inline" &#124; "block" | Flex direction of the input group. Defaults to `inline`.                                                                                                              |
